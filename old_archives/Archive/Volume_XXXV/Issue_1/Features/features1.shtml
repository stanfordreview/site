              <p class="headline">Maintaining Free Expression on Campus: <em>An Interview with Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students</em></p>
              <p class="byline">by <a href="http://www.stanfordreview.org/About/Staff/nkadaba.shtml">Navin Kadaba</a></p>
              <p class="byline">Assistant Features Editor</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>When my freshman year was drawing to a close, I had the pleasure of meeting Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims, Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students. I learned early on in the year that to the newcomers on campus, Dean Julie was the center of our universe. During orientation, Dean Julie led the freshmen in everything from rallying our dorm spirits to introducing us to famous authors and Stanford professors. It was clear that she cared about each and every one of us; we could always count on her to keep our class together. Due to her profound level of involvement with the freshmen, I thought it would be great to sit down with her and chat about the political climate on the Stanford Campus. In this interview, Dean Julie offers insight and advice about Stanford&rsquo;s political climate not only for freshmen, but for everyone seeking to improve campus-wide political discussion. </p>
              <p><em>Navin: How long have you been Freshman Dean and how would you classify your experience here? </em></p>
              <p>Dean Julie: I became Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students in the Summer of 2002, so 3 years. How would I classify the experience? It&rsquo;s been a wild ride. We think of ourselves as having a startup at Stanford. It&rsquo;s been full of brainstorming ideas and a lot of uncertainty but it&rsquo;s been incredibly rewarding and now three years into it we feel that we are very much a part of the Stanford Experience. This year we changed our name to Freshmen Dean&rsquo;s Office. </p>
              <p><em>N: How much of your experience as a Stanford Undergraduate has affected the work you&rsquo;ve done here? </em></p>
              <p>J: I think my experience as an undergraduate affects my role to a great degree. First of all my memories of my student experience and the pride I have has an alumna give me fuel in my role here as Dean of Freshman. I think any alum hopes that their alma mater is delivering the same experience, or better experience, if that&rsquo;s possible, than what we experienced as students, and so it&rsquo;s such a joy to be here now and to have the opportunity to be a part of Stanford and handing the Stanford tradition and experience down to the next generation. </p>
              <p><em>N: What would you say are the toughest issues Stanford Freshmen face coming onto campus? </em></p>
              <p>J: Probably the unbridled freedom and independence, which essentially means not only do you have more resources, more opportunities, more activities available to you than before, but you have fewer constrains on your time imposed by anybody else. There isn&rsquo;t a rigid course schedule, there isn&rsquo;t someone waking you up every morning, reminding you to do your homework and telling you to go to class. It&rsquo;s the confluence of those two things that can cause a bit of chaos, and for most freshmen they have to come up with their own recalibration for what needs to be done, all within the context of not having a parent breathing over your shoulder. Also, I think that for so many years, the typical Stanford student has had a clear sense of the &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; to achieve, the next set of expectations to meet and exceed; there&rsquo;s a sense in high school these days of the next thing that&rsquo;s expected. I think that when you come here, that exists to a much lesser extent, unless you have your eyes firmly rooted on, say, being a physician, which is a good example. There are few paths that are that linear. I think it&rsquo;s wonderfully freeing and liberating, and students who have been programmed to think about the &ldquo;next step&rdquo; can find the unbridled freedom and independence to not only cause issues with time management. But it also can be frightening, because it&rsquo;s not obvious what the next step should be. We want students in these four years, which are probably the four years of greatest independence they could experience, to explore the life of the mind, and to get to know themself better and develop a sense of what really interests them and to pursue that interest. And nobody here is going to tell you to follow a particular path. You&rsquo;re on your own in that sense and that can be somewhat frightening. And enthralling as well! </p>
              <p><em>N: The Review was founded during your undergraduate years, and I was wondering, what are your thoughts were on the matter back then? </em></p>
              <p>J: Founder Peter Thiel and I were in the same freshman dorm. I didn&rsquo;t know him well, but I remember when it was founded. Since I am a believer in the free expression of ideas, while I&rsquo;m not a regular reader of the Review, I think it&rsquo;s important that we have newspapers reflecting a lot of different perspectives on this campus. </p>
              <p><em>N: When you were at Stanford in the late 80&rsquo;s did you ever feel that there were issues with political diversity on campus? </em></p>
              <p>J: Well, since I&rsquo;ve been part of the Stanford community it has always felt like a liberal community, and that was true then and I think it&rsquo;s true now. </p>
              <p><em>N: To the best of your knowledge, how diverse do you think Stanford&rsquo;s political views are on campus? </em></p>
              <p>J: I think we&rsquo;re probably a place with a lot of centrists, a lot of people who are moderate on either side. That&rsquo;s what I perceive, as we&rsquo;re not a terribly activist campus. I think there are probably liberal students here who wish the place was more activist, and there are probably very conservative students here who are wishing their ideology had more of a voice. So, I think the people who are the majority are probably in that centrist middle, moderate republicans or moderate democrats. </p>
              <p><em>N: Do you believe students feel safe expressing conservative political opinions on campus? </em></p>
              <p>J: I certainly hope they do. Whether they do or not is something I can&rsquo;t be sure of. It is a very personal thing, feeling safe expressing a viewpoint. It has so much to do with your own convictions, and the amount of respect you feel, regardless of your viewpoint as an individual. I believe we are a campus where people feel safe in expressing their viewpoints in class and in their dorms. </p>
              <p><em>N: Do you feel that some conservative students are marginalized on campus? For example, the racks of papers that are recycled immediately after distribution? </em></p>
              <p>J: I feel that the conservative voice is powerful, well funded and well supported, so, no, I don&rsquo;t have a sense that the conservative voice is marginalized. I would hate to see a stack of Reviews in the recycling bin, I would hate to see a stack of Dailys in the recycling bin, and I would hate to see a stack of The Real News in the recycling bin. That&rsquo;s an unfortunate way to express opposition to a viewpoint. </p>
              <p><em>N: I have fond memories of the &rsquo;08 cheers at my freshman orientation; have you thought about what you&rsquo;re going to do when the class of &rsquo;10 comes in? </em></p>
              <p>J: [laughs] Navin, I&rsquo;ve been struggling with this almost since I started in this role with the class of &rsquo;06, and we are half a year away because we unveil the cheer at Admit Weekend. I&rsquo;m struggling mightily, and I&rsquo;ve had a lot of suggestions, people have suggested twenty-ten, that is for the first time to emphasize the 20 part. So it would be &rsquo;08, &rsquo;09, 20-10. Or one-oh or oh-ten. Do you have any ideas? </p>
              <p><em>N: I haven&rsquo;t, I just realized today when I was thinking about orientation I thought, wait a minute, &rsquo;05, &rsquo;06, &rsquo;07, &rsquo;09, then&hellip; </em></p>
              <p>J; Oh no. [laughs]. So right now, it&rsquo;s Oh no, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;10. We&rsquo;ll have to figure it out. I actually think we should start a tradition of the preceding freshman class naming the new class; that is, coming up with a cheer, a call for them. So we might work with the frosh council next year, the class of &rsquo;09, and have them figure it out. It could be part punishment, right? If the then sophomores are naming the freshman, we wouldn&rsquo;t want them to be malicious, but they could have a lot of fun with that. </p>
              <p><em>N: Do you have any advice for the incoming freshmen with regards to adjusting to Stanford, in particular, with expressing their views? </em></p>
              <p>J: Just be yourself, and have confidence that this is a community where ideas are exchanged and people are respected. But also, step outside your comfort zone and talk to others who are different than you and be open to new ideas and be respectful of others. </p>
              <p><em>N: Okay, excellent. And finally, last but not least, what do you think of The Stanford Review? </em></p>
              <p>J: Well, as I have said at the outset, I believe this is a campus where different viewpoints can be exchanged. But if you cross a line and you&rsquo;re just insulting people, people are going to get polarized and they&rsquo;re going to throw your newspaper away. For example, there is no reason for the Indian mascot. It&rsquo;s a relic of the past and it belongs in the past. It&rsquo;s insulting to Native Americans, and hopefully everybody. If that kind of thing could go away, Native American students could feel that this paper isn&rsquo;t something that is out to get them, making your paper better received. Also, since you say your paper is not well received, I think that if the Review does some introspective work about its reputation it would be great. When you know exactly what is it you wish to achieve, ask whether your reputation is consistent with that. I think that would be terrific for both the people and the reputation of the Review. I&rsquo;m saddened when I hear about an article in the Review that in my mind has crossed the line and is more about insulting people or making fun of a group of people then about exchanging ideas. But I support and encourage people of different viewpoints to speak their minds. There are good pieces of journalism published in The Review, and I think that is a great thing. </p>
              <p><em>N: Thank you very much for your time, I&rsquo;m so glad I had this opportunity to meet you. </em></p>
              <p>J: It was a pleasure meeting you, and good luck with the Review!</p>
