              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>At McGill University in Montreal, Orientation Week went well this year. A few thousand freshmen unpacked the exact same easy-store laundry basket from Linens n&rsquo; Things, found out that their roommate thinks that he&rsquo;s the second coming of Clinton or Jordan or Jesus, and then proceeded to get certifiably wasted (Jesus from Portland politely abstained). Maybe they went bar-hopping along St. Laurent or Crescent. Maybe they played Beirut in their freshman lounge. Maybe they visited the beer tents on the front lawn. </p>
              <p>At Stanford University in California, Orientation Week went well this year. A group of four very nervous Cedro residents biked over to Safeway and tried to buy two cases of Keystone, a handle of Gordon&rsquo;s&hellip; and a jug of Carlo Rossi (&ldquo;wine makes us look older, you see, Danny&rdquo;). Unfortunately the Carlo Rossi would have scanned just about as well as Danny&rsquo;s $75 South Dakota fake, and four very sober Cedro residents were reduced to begging from that Branner kid whose mom left her son with a credit card and some Jack Daniels. </p>
              <p>These are, it is clear, two divergent alcohol existences. </p>
              <p>At Stanford, Orientation Week was sponsored by university administrators and our rollicking tuitions. At McGill, orientation week was sponsored by Molson, one of Canada&rsquo;s largest breweries. It set a classic scene: McGill&rsquo;s version of the Oval covered with tents serving different flavors of Canada&rsquo;s version of Coors. Red orientation booklets strewn about because the girl from down the hall wanted a beer too, please. People milling about, meeting each other, having a good time. Alcohol, that tried and true social lubricant, overseeing the whole production, and making sure that no actor forgot his lines. </p>
              <p>At Stanford &ndash; or Berkeley or Harvard or US College XYZ &ndash; the minimum legal drinking age is 21. At McGill, the minimum legal drinking age is 18. </p>
              <p>Of course, McGill may just be the epicenter of corruption, Canadianism, or Europeanism. That is certainly one argument. Back in 1982, when Reagan proposed federal legislation forcing all states to adhere to 21-or-over, taking alcohol away was intended to be a social cure-all. Less hooliganism, less alcoholism, less drunk driving, less youth fatalities. </p>
              <p>And to a degree, Reagan et al. were right: but they were right at the expense of liberty and the expense of a better solution. </p>
              <p>The current alcohol regime, fueled by the sensationalist claims of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and successive administrations afraid to confront the powerful neoprohibition lobby, is unapologetically totalitarian. We understand, it says, that it seems unfair that 18 year-old Americans can vote and sign contracts and die for their country, but are not permitted to have a drink to celebrate. But drinking and voting are two very different things, two very different responsibilities. And hey, life&rsquo;s unfair. </p>
              <p>Sometime this year, MADD will set up their guilt wagon on Palm Drive. Inside an enormous glass cube, a crushed car will serve as a reminder to all those who pass that alcohol (in particular, alcohol on college campuses) leads to death and carnage and probably babies too. Just beyond the horrible scene, orange pylons direct drivers into a police checkpoint, as if the concerned Mothers expect a dramatic confession: &ldquo;Forgive me Officer, for I have sinned! I&rsquo;m not drunk now, but I had a beer last Friday&hellip; and I&rsquo;m only 19!&rdquo; In the world according to MADD, alcohol is both a cause and a manifestation of all of society&rsquo;s evils. </p>
              <p>&ldquo;Underage drinking is more than a rite of passage,&rdquo; warns the MADD website. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an invitation to clouded judgment, limited control and consequences that can last a lifetime.&rdquo; Age 21, they argue, was chosen because when certain states lowered the age to 18, they observed more youth alcohol-related fatalities. And thus the argument proves itself. </p>
              <p>Or does it? </p>
              <p>The United States is almost alone in its totalitarian alcohol policies. In Canada, the minimum legal drinking age is 18 or 19, depending on the province. In Israe, Singapore and the United Kingdom, it is 18 (although in England children can drink under their parents&rsquo; supervision from age 5). In Switzerland, Italy, Germany, and the Philippines, youth can begin legally drinking at age 16. And countries such as Spain and Denmark have no minimum legal drinking age at all, instead trusting their youngest citizens with the responsibility of imbibing responsibly. In fact, pretty much the only countries with minimum legal drinking ages comparable to the United States are those paragons of liberty and rational policy, Egypt and North Korea.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, Spanish, Canadian or Swiss college students are no more likely to drink themselves into the hospital than American students. In fact, exactly the opposite trends have been observed: the United States, despite its supposedly enlightened drinking policies, deals with a greater incidence of binge drinking among youth than its less puritanical neighbors in North America and overseas. </p>
              <p>When MADD suggests that underage drinking is a more than a rite of passage, they may be right, but their recommended policy serves merely to postpone that rite of passage and all of the side effects that come along with it. In the interim, high school and college students are spoon-fed moralistic platitudes that reinforce the alcohol &ldquo;taboo.&rdquo; America professes to be a nation of liberty and responsibility, but refuses to entrust that sort of responsibility and send that message of liberty to its youngest generation. Europe, for once, may have nailed it better. By removing the taboo from alcohol, these countries have also effectively dispatched with the &ldquo;fake ID culture&rdquo; that infects college life. There&rsquo;s not nearly so much pregaming in Montreal, no hiding in rooms or buying handles of cheap vodka. Remember: freedom breeds responsibility, not the other way around. </p>
              <p>Upon retiring from Middlebury College in Vermont, respected former College president John McCardell Jr. lashed out against the minimum legal drinking age. McCardell argued that &ldquo;denying college students legal access to alcohol is the equivalent to denying oil paint to art students and still expecting graduates to know how to paint an oil portrait.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>The drinking age is &ldquo;bad social policy and terrible law.&rdquo; McCardell added. &ldquo;No college president would say that drinking has become less of a problem in the years since the age was raised.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>And yet states are held hostage by a threat to remove federal highway funds if they were to lower the age. The totalitarian neoprohibition lobby in Washington wields the proverbial beer can once again. </p>
              <p>Here at Stanford, we can thank our lucky stars that the administration is one of the lamer enforcers of alcohol policy at colleges nationwide. Still, hundreds of freshman will break the law this week. </p>
              <p>And up in Montreal, another successful &ndash; and responsible &ndash; Orientation Week has concluded at McGill. The body count? Alcohol related fatalities: zero. Unplanned pregnancies: zero. Liberty and responsibility: a whole hell of a lot. </p>
              <p>I guess I&rsquo;ll drink to that.</p>
