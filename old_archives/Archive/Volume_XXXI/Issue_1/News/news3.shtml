<p> Stanford Dining Revamps Tresidder
<p>Stanford Dining has added new options to Tresidder Union for hungry students. 
  After taking control of the Tresidder dining area from Bon Appetit last year, 
  Stanford Dining has decided to bring in more outside restaurant chains in response 
  to student dining interests. A few of the restaurants under consideration for 
  contracts included In-N-Out Burger, Pizza Hut, and Subway. In-N-Out eventually 
  was rejected by Stanford Dining and the Tresidder Dining Advisory Group due 
  to In-N-Out's demands; which included a stipulation that In-N-Out must own the 
  property on which it is located. Dining Services' investigation of vendors was 
  conducted during the summer and under time and financial constraints. The first 
  two restaurants will be Peet's Coffee and Subway, which will open in October. 
  Meanwhile, other restaurants, including sushi, pizza, and possibly Indian food, 
  will be added later. Dining Services has stated that it will flexibly change 
  the vendors in order to best answer student requests.</p>
<p> Students with meal plans that include points may apply up to 50 points per 
  quarter toward these dining options. Dining Services has also modified the CoHo's 
  menu and dining areas, such as by eliminating the Starbucks products with Peet's 
  Coffee and adding furniture. Dining Services has also expressed interest in 
  improving the air conditioning and adding wireless internet access in Tresidder. 
  As part of an agreement that Stanford University made regarding the deal, former 
  Bon Appetit employees were given preference by Dining Services for the new Tresidder 
  positions, and virtually all of the former Bon Appetit staff has been rehired.</p>
<p>Noted Hoover Fellow Passes Away</p>
<p> Edward Teller, a Senior Hoover Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution on 
  Stanford campus, died on September 9, 2003. Dr. Teller's particular fields of 
  expertise were in defense and energy policy for national and international concerns. 
  Dr. Teller played an important role in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during 
  the development of the atomic bomb and the first atomic nuclear reactor. He 
  became a professor of physics at the University of Chicago in 1946, but eventually 
  returned to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory three years later. Dr. Teller was 
  the first chairman of the Nuclear Reaction Safeguard committee. He was a strong 
  proponent of the research surrounding the development of the hydrogen bomb and 
  firmly believed in a strong national defense as a deterrent to the Soviet Union's 
  military threat. He later became an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative 
  (also known as Star Wars). Dr. Teller's peers occasionally criticized him, as 
  his vigorous belief in the continual need to increase American military power 
  conflicted with the more pacifistic beliefs of some of his colleagues. While 
  at Los Alamos a rift developed between Dr. Teller and his fellow scientists; 
  Dr. Teller believed that the other scientists were too hesitant to develop nuclear 
  weaponry. The antagonistic relationship with many of his peers when the nuclear 
  physicist Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent anti-nuclear weapon advocate, had 
  his security clearance revoked for national security reasons; Dr. Teller was 
  held by many people to have been responsible the event, although Dr. Teller 
  did not make any accusations himself. Dr. Teller was also a prominent advocate 
  of fusion power as an alternative energy source. He was 95 when he died.</p>
<p>Stanford Bookstore Computers Temporarily Offline</p>
<p> The Stanford Bookstore's computers were taken temporarily offline from September 
  15 to September 17. A corrupted file was the apparent cause of the disturbance, 
  which forced the Bookstore to use backup files for their services from the 17th 
  to the 20th. Bookstore employees were forced to write receipts out by hand. 
  The crash inconvenienced many students who were buying books for the then-immediate 
  beginning of the quarter, and many tourists were visiting Stanford as well. 
  This event has happened before on a similar date, which the Bookstore also repaired. 
</p>

<p>University Nixes New Laundry Plan</p>
<p> A much-anticipated new flat-rate laundry policy has been rejected by Stanford 
  University in favor of its old coin-operated Laundromats. The decision not to 
  use the policy, in which students would be charged a flat $28 per quarter to 
  do laundry to receive unlimited access to dorm washing machines, was based on 
  a series of complaints and concerns that Undergraduate Housing Operations received 
  from students at the end of Spring Quarter 2003. The ASSU proposed the system, 
  which would have gone into effect this year, at the end of Spring Quarter 2003. 
  The program was supposed to address rising Laundromat costs and reduce the burden 
  on students for laundry. However, since the ASSU's proposal arrived at the end 
  of Spring Quarter, there was not enough time for housing to address the many 
  student concerns raised by the proposed program. A proposed letter addressed 
  to the student body as a whole explaining the new proposal was drafted but never 
  sent out. Furthermore, housing decided that the ASSU had not sufficiently consulted 
  with the student body as a whole and that there was not enough time to address 
  the student concerns. Student Housing remains open, however, to future ideas 
  for unlimited laundry plans and will be holding more focus groups and surveys 
  to determine the feasibility of implementing such a plan next year. </p>
<p> Row Houses on Probation</p>
<p>Three Row Houses have been put on social probation for violation of alcohol 
  drinking rules during freshman orientation. Theta Delta Chi, 680 Lomita, and 
  Xanadu were placed on probation for 30 days for serving alcohol during the period 
  of time in which New Student Orientation was held, and failing to follow proper 
  guidelines. The houses will have to participate in a program that will examine 
  their actions, and any further violations of University guidelines will result 
  in a year-long probation. The fraternities generally accepted responsibility 
  for the situation and have promised to make amends, although some of them denied 
  knowing about the unusual circumstances for New Student Orientation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ASSU Refuses to Endorse Coaltion Against Prop. 54</p>
<p>The ASSU Senate entertained a bill on September 30 that would have endorsed 
  the Stanford Coalition Against Proposition 54. The Coalition is a cooperative 
  effort among several student groups organized for the explicit purpose of rallying 
  students to defeat Prop. 54. The bill was written as an endorsement of a student 
  group that was against Prop. 54, instead of an actual endorsement against 54, 
  in an attempt to sidestep the ASSU's Constitution, which prohibits political 
  statements about issues that do not directly affect Stanford students. Proponents 
  of the bill suggested that the political cause of the Coalition did not matter, 
  and that an ASSU endorsement would merely be supporting political activism. 
  In response, the Coalition For Proposition 54, an amalgamation of various conservative 
  groups on campus, challenged the ASSU to amend the bill to include an endorsement 
  of both the Coalition For and the Coalition Against Proposition 54. This amendment, 
  requiring a simple majority, was defeated 5-8, with 2 abstentions. However, 
  the original bill endorsing only the Coalition Against Proposition 54, requiring 
  two-thirds majority of all voting members to pass, also failed 7-4 with 4 abstentions.
