Viennese Ball Double-Charging Sparks ASSU Constitutional Action
</font><br>

<b>by Ryan Wisnesky</b><br>
News Staff<p>

Last month the student body voted to give Special Fees of around $2 per person to the Viennese Ball.  However, due to a recent decision by the ASSU Constitutional Council, the Viennese Ball's days on the Special Fee ballot may be numbered.
<p>
The Viennese Ball is an annual Stanford tradition in which 900 students dance the night away at an off campus hotel.  Touted as "the oldest Viennese Ball west of the Mississippi," the Viennese Ball Committee not only puts on the Ball, but it also hosts many free events, such as dance lessons, throughout Autumn and Winter Quarters.  
<p>
Tickets to the dance cost $37.50 per student.  A large portion of the Special Fee that the Viennese Ball Committee receives is used to pull the direct cost to student attendees down to this price.<p>
Because the Viennese Ball receives Special Fees, it must comply with the clauses of the ASSU Constitution pertaining specifically to Special Fee groups.  One of these clauses states that every student who has paid a group's Special Fee must be allowed to participate in events hosted by that group.
In a motion brought before the ASSU Constitutional Council, former Review Editor-in-Chief Henry Towsner argued that charging student attendees for tickets in addition to the Special Fee violates the ASSU Constitution. Towsner suggested that the practice of double-charging was a violation of the both the letter and spirit of the student government's constitution.  <p>
In response, representatives of the Viennese Ball Committee argued that they are in compliance with the ASSU Constitution because no student has been prevented from purchasing a ticket.  They also claimed that, because the ASSU itself had never questioned the double-charging practice, they are in accordance with the current interpretation of the rule.
 After hearing both sides, the Constitutional Council ruled in favor of Towsner.  Although the Viennese Ball Committee will be allowed to continue double-charging for the next academic year, it will be required to comply in the 2004-2005 academic year.<p>
Although Towsner's motion was targeted specifically at the Viennese Ball, the ruling applies to all groups that charge Special Fees.  Other groups, such as the Stanford Concert Network, may also be required to conform to the ruling.  However, it is as yet unclear if separate suits will be necessary to facilitate broader enforcement.<p>
When asked about his motivation for filing the suit, Towsner noted that "it's pretty unethical to take people's money for the purpose of providing a service, but then demanding that people cough up more money before they actually get anything for it."  Given the extremely large special fee budgets that are drastically increasing from year to year, Towsner hopes that enforcing the current laws will help alleviate the budgetary problems facing the ASSU.<p>
The ramifications of the suit will not be felt for at least another year.  However, the Viennese Ball Committee and other groups that double-charge are already scrambling to come up with a response.  According to Howard Shen, the 2002-2003 Treasurer and 2003-2004 Co-chair of the Viennese Ball Committee, there are several actions the committee could take, including moving the event back to campus, raising prices, fundraising, or not charging for tickets at all.
According to Shen, should the Ball move back to campus, "ticket prices would drop slightly, but because far less tickets will be available, the drop will not be much more than $7.50 per ticket.  Also, as in the past, a black market for tickets will most likely develop."<p>
The prospect of making up the budget shortfall by raising prices is simply impractical, said Shen. "To cover the Special Fee revenue without cutting costs, ticket prices would rise by nearly $15 per student.  Far fewer students will be willing to pay that much to attend the ball, and the Committee will cycle between decreasing ticket sales and increasing ticket prices until the Committee is forced to disband."<p>
Shen also noted that the Viennese Ball Committee has been trying to engage in off-campus fundraising for quite some time, and has even sold advertisements.  However, "the depressed economy and the University budget cuts have largely stifled our attempts at large scale fund-raising," Shen said.<p>
The final alternative is to try to draw funds for the Ball solely from Special Fees.  Given current costs, however, doing so would require at least tripling the Special Fee request.  If every Special Fee group that double-charged increased its Special Fees to compensate, Special Fee budgets could quickly grow out of control.  <p>
Besides working to comply with the ruling, members of the Viennese Ball Committee are also working to change it. One way in which they are trying to modify the Constitutional Council's new interpretation is to show the student body its more extreme ramifications.<p>
"How many student groups ask the student body to subsidize something for a very small percentage of the population?" asked Shen.  "The answer may surprise you.  After all, such honorable groups as Alternative Spring Break and Volunteers in Latin America violate this [double-charging] idea.  By this logic, every student should be able to go on an Alternative Spring Break, regardless of the application process."
Aside from mobilizing the student body to amend the ASSU Constitution, there is little that the Viennese Ball Committee can do to fight the ruling.  Some students have suggesting that the Viennese Ball Committee file suit against the other double-charging groups, in the hope that once every group has been forced to shut down, the ASSU would be forced to act.  <p>However, the Viennese Ball Committee does not endorse such radical actions.  "We don't believe filing against other groups would benefit either us or the student body," said Shen.<p>
Although some students agree that the decision to enforce the new constitutional interpretation the Viennese Ball is a good idea, student response has been mostly negative.  <p>
Sophomore Erik Goossens expresses a common sentiment among students: "The spirit of the ASSU Constitution is to prevent organizations from turning a profit.  Viennese Ball is expensive, so it wouldn't be fair to place that burden all on Special Fees.  But it's also a Stanford tradition that many people want to participate in at least once. Thus it's unfair to place the extra $25 entirely on the dancers, especially for $2 per person in fees. They're just meeting expenses; they should be allowed to continue their practice."<p>
Other students express hope that because the ASSU Constitutional Council may be reconstituted soon, the new council membership might reverse the recent ruling.  However, for the time being, a Stanford tradition will try its best to respond to shifting political winds. <p>
