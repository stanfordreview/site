<i>Stanford Review News Writer Laura Billadello Speaks with Stanford University President John Hennessy</i>

<p>

Thursday, February 27, 2003<br>
11AM<br>
Building 10, Main Quad, Stanford University
<p>
<i>How does our affirmative action policy compare to the University of Michigan's? </i>
<p>
Michigan uses affirmative action at the undergraduate level, understanding that there are two different programs that are being contested at Michigan, the undergraduate program and the law school program, which use different mechanisms to create a more diverse class.  Neither one of them is at all like what we do.  The undergraduate program actually uses a formulaic mechanism that adds points to people from designated underrepresented minorities and therefore tries to in some strange way equate being in a certain racial class with achieving a certain corresponding difference in terms of academic performance which I don't think is probably the appropriate mechanism.  At the law school level a different mechanism is used.  But the goal of achieving a certain diversity in the class is the goal of the mechanism.  So in any event, what we do is completely different and tries to consider each person as an individual understanding what their academic opportunities, family history, background, geographical representation might be in the picture and how all those things stand and what they add to the class.  
<p>
<i>So, if our affirmative action policy is so different from Michigan's, how can we support theirs?</i>
<p>
This is a subtlety.  If you actually look at our brief you'll see that it doesn't say anything about the Michigan program.  Our goal, and we would be I suspect perfectly happy if the Bakke decision is preserved in this case.  Because our goal is that we would like the ability to continue to use race as one consideration among many in the admissions process.  
<p>
<i>What does the fact that we are on the amicus brief say about Stanford University?</i>
<p>
First of all, there is a statement that says we believe having diversity in our undergraduate student body provides a better learning environment for all our students.  One point on our particular brief as opposed to the general statement, which we certainly support, is that there are compelling reasons to achieve that diversity in science and engineering just as there are in the social sciences and humanities and pre-law programs and other things.  The other thing I think it says, which actually reflects something that's the major point made by the amicus brief by the US military is that we believe that it's in the best interest of the country to have a diversified workforce in various sectors.  And therefore we as educational institutions have a calling to help create that diversified workforce.  Which is basically the same argument the military brief makes--that they need a diverse officer core, and therefore they need to somehow take race into account to achieve that.
<p>
<i>You say we are striving to achieve diversity.  How do we know when we as a university have achieved diversity?</i>
<p>
I don't know that there is any simple answer to that question.  One could look at a variety of things.  Certainly, if it were the case that the educational opportunities available to young people across the country at the K-12 level were equal, then one could argue that should naturally bring about diversity at the college level.  Now they're obviously not equal, I think anybody could quickly tell you that.  So how that would gain a natural balance of diversity would certainly be an interesting question to ask.  I can probably say how do we know we're reaching too far or making too many compromises in the interest of diversity?  I'd say we're making too many compromises when something other than academic capability becomes the first criterion.  If something other than academic capability becomes the first criterion we look at then we're clearly sacrificing too much to achieve that diversity.  But it's much harder to say how do we know that we've achieved it.  Are we happy with the diversity of our undergraduate class?  Yes, I'd say we are happy with it.  Do we feel it needs to be a more diverse class?  I don't think there's a strong argument that it needs to be more diverse than it currently is.  
<p>
<i>How effective do you think Stanford's affirmative action policy has been?</i>
<p>
Well I think if we look at the evidence, the evidence is it works pretty well.  We have achieved a great deal of diversity in our undergraduate class. We have strong graduation rates by any measure whether you look at racial background, geographical background, or gender.  So I think from that perspective it has worked well.  I think from the perspective of accomplishing an important educational goal, which is preparing our graduates to operate in a very diverse working environment and preparing them for what will inevitably be a society where they are required to work with people from very different backgrounds.  According to at least the anecdotal feedback I get from students that seems to work quite well.  It's still one of the interesting statements about society that despite the diversity of our incoming class if you ask students what the people they grew up with were like, what were the people they went to high school with like, we still live in a largely segregated society.  So there is a very important role and maybe a lot of that probably happens in some classes and residences of getting people to learn how to relate to people from very different backgrounds.  And I believe that's important and it's an important part of the educational process.  It's one of the things you certainly strive for on a residential campus as opposed to a campus that isn't so.  So I think we feel pretty good about it.  
<p>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<p>
You didn't ask any of the hard questions.
<p>
<i>The hard questions like what?</i>
<p>
The question I'd ask is isn't the problem with affirmative action that it discriminates against some individuals in favor of other individuals.  And I'd say the answer is that's what makes it challenging.  That's what always causes people who really think hard about it some concern.  Keeping that balance of trying to think about the good of the entire class and what your educational goals are and how you best achieve--that is what you have to keep in mind.  And so obviously, if you set up a system that the idea is it has to overly favor one group and heavily discriminate against another group then you have to ask. . . ..
<p>
<i>Is there a group being heavily discriminated against?</i>
<p>
Probably not but in some sense in any. . . .I don't know that there's a group being heavily discriminated against.  One of the interesting things to look at would be to see what's happened to the admitted classes at Berkeley before and after 209 and reflect on that and what that change might be.  It is a very interesting question to ask how that whole dynamic works.  I think the public institutions with formulaic admissions processes probably have the most difficulty in this kind of situation.  Because they're not drawing so much from across the country, they're admitting a larger class, they're having a harder time if they want to achieve diversity without making larger compromises in the quality of the students they are admitting over the quality of students they aren't admitting.  But I think the students who brought up the lawsuit in the University of Michigan case, I suspect they feel discriminated against.  And so how you achieve that right balance, realizing that in any admissions process there will be some people who feel they should have gotten in but they didn't.  Even in a formulaic admissions process you can argue over how the points are given out in the Michigan system and say Ôis the system fair?'  Well no admissions process is completely fair in the agreement of the unanimity of the people.  Each admissions process obviously makes some judgments about the relative importance of high school academic record, SAT scores, recommendations, all these sorts of things.  It's a difficult process to make it all work.  It's a challenge and you have to keep in mind what the goals are and what you're willing to do for those goals.  And make sure you feel comfortable with the end as well as the means.  
<p>
<b>Question from Photographer Ron Gutmark</b><br>
<i>Do you feel that affirmative action makes those underrepresented minorities who are involved with it feel like their achievements mean less?</i>
<p>
	When done incorrectly, it certainly does.  But I think if you look at how we interpreted affirmative action at different levels, for example if you look at what we've done at tenure consideration time where we basically follow a single standard.  I think a part of the reluctance to consider issues that would normally be considered in an affirmative action process at that point is exactly that issue.  I think people should be promoted, to tenure for example, on their merits.  And that everybody should feel they got there on their merits and that is a very dangerous thing.  There is a fundamental interesting philosophical question here.  If you view the measures that many institutions take as justified by two criteria.  One is the educational or institutional goals which benefit from having a diverse group whether it's students or faculty or staff.  And you view the other argument as one of how do you factor in the lack of equity in earlier stages of the educational system. The second factor obviously is one that over time you expect to diminish.  So it's one thing to consider it at the undergraduate level.  Possibly it should be considered as a smaller factor at the graduate level.  By the time you get to talking about hiring faculty for example that factor is really going to diminish.  And if you look at what we do on the undergraduate side, hiring junior faculty, it's a rather different notion of affirmative action that focuses much more on outreach and trying to ensure that you attract a diversified pool of candidates and that you perhaps in some areas are willing to be a little opportunistic, reflecting the fact that in many disciplines, minorities or for example in engineering disciplines women are still in scarce supply.  So the meaning of affirmative action on the faculty level then is much more one of outreach and being opportunistic. Realizing that the number of highly qualified minority or in some disciplines women candidates that you may see for the faculty is so small that when one comes along you may want to consider making an additional, not promote that person over somebody you would hire who you determined was strictly better, but making an additional appointment for example to try to take advantage of the opportunity.  It really is interpreted with a range of subtleties that change as you look at who we're applying affirmative action with respect to.
