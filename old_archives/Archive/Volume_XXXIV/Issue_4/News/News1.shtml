		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>Every freshman is familiar with Stanford&rsquo;s Introduction to the Humanities Program, more commonly referred to as IHUM. Taken by the vast majority of freshmen to satisfy the Area 1 Gen eral Educational Requirement (GER), IHUM occupies a central role in campus academic life. IHUM, along with the Program in Writing and Rhetoric, is one of the only course sequences common to nearly the whole student body. The program is the best approximation to an intellectual foundation shared by the entire student body. Unfortunately, the IHUM program completely fails to provide a com mon foundation, whether content or skill based. The program also ignores students&rsquo; desire to read great works. Instead IHUM attempts to focus on building writing, argumentative, and critical thinking skills, but fails to do even that. IHUM needs to refocus in order to better meet students&rsquo; needs. </p>
		  <p>IHUM owes its existence to controversy over Stanford&rsquo;s previous core curricula. From 1935 to 1969, Stanford freshmen were required to study the &ldquo;History of Western Civilization,&rdquo; a traditional introduction to the so called classics of Western thought. This requirement disappeared for a decade in the wake of the students&rsquo; movement of the 1960s, but was reincarnated as &ldquo;Western Culture&rdquo; in 1980. These programs were modeled after Columbia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Books&rdquo; course and introductory courses on Western civilization from Columbia and the University of Chicago. They took an approach that treated European civilization as a cohe sive unit, focused on the texts instead of on commentary, and were generally taught like history classes. West ern Culture, for example had many different tracks but mandated that all students read a set of core works that included Genesis, selections from the New Testament, Plato&rsquo;s Republic, Machiavelli&rsquo;s Prince, Voltaire&rsquo;s Candide, and Marx and Engel&rsquo;s Commu nist Manifesto. Such programs tried to fulfill the uniquely American ideal of a broad liberal arts education by giving students direct exposure to the sources of Western civilization. </p>
		  <p>But in the late 1980s, students and faculty began to demand a more diverse core curriculum that exposed students to other cultures (&ldquo;Hey hey, ho ho, Western Civ has got to go!&rdquo;). Stanford quickly became the center of a nationwide debate on the components of a liberal arts education. In 1988, Stanford&rsquo;s feminist and minority departments, along with the Black Student Union, succeeded in pressuring the Faculty Senate into creating a new set of courses, called &ldquo;Culture, Ideas and Values&rdquo; (CIV) that was &ldquo;to provide students with the common intellectual experience of broadening their under standing of ideas and values drawn from different strands of our own culture, and to increase their understanding of cultural diversity and the process of cultural interaction.&rdquo; The reading list was dropped in favor of a category based approach and courses were to &ldquo;to give substantial attention to the issues of race, gender, and class during each academic quarter.&rdquo; The general popu lace was outraged at the latest outbreak of liberal multiculturalism: Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s Secretary of Education, Wil liam Bennet, even debated Stanford President Donald Kennedy after the university dropped the reading list. </p>
		  <p>In the coming years, CIV&rsquo;s short comings became apparent. According to Norman Book, a co-founder of The Stanford Review who was at Stanford during the transition from Western Culture to CIV, existing Western Cul ture tracks stayed more or less the same but newer CIV tracks were less rigorous and often political. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t introduce great works from other cultures,&rdquo; he recalls, &ldquo;they introduced Western, politically radical, liberal authors.&rdquo; He also believes the thematic arrangement of material, as opposed to the chronological presentation seen in Western Culture, allowed professors to push their own political agendas. The Faculty Senate, in legislation that detailed the rationale for creating IHUM, pointed out different flaws in the program&rsquo;s execution, but not in its approach: &ldquo;Once the rationale of a &lsquo;culture&rsquo; or &lsquo;civ&rsquo; course was to read particular works forming the core of Civilization, but with the assault on cultural parochialism and superficiality, a better one seems to us a broad gauged study of what constitutes the humanities.... We can not conceive of, and would not sanction, an introductory course sequence in humanistic study that didn&rsquo;t include, for instance, multicultural perspectives, attention to gender, race, religion, social identities, and significant texts by women and men of various cultures and ethnicities.&rdquo; IHUM was established to address specific difficulties such as &ldquo;the need to focus on fewer texts and study them more closely; the need to involve a broader range of faculty and departments in course instruction; the desirability of the better integration of works from outside the traditional Western canon; the importance of greater uniformity of intellectual standards and academic expectations; and the necessity for smaller discussion classes with more time in order to allow for the articulation and consideration of different points of view.&rdquo; While the program differs from CIV in significant ways, it is largely its heir. </p>
		  <p>Does IHUM share CIV&rsquo;s problems of politicization? Professor Orrin Robinson, director of the IHUM program, says &ldquo;We do discourage [professors taking partisan political stances in classes], and I think these things are pretty self-regulating.... Professors are like any other human beings, but they ought to keep it out of the classroom. And I think, on the whole, they do keep it out of the classroom.... If people find instances of it that are blatant, they should bring it to me, and we will take action.&rdquo; Professor Chris Bobonich, who teaches some philosophy-oriented IHUM classes and is on the IHUM Governance Board, concurs: &ldquo;I try very hard to avoid the politicization of my IHUM courses. I don&rsquo;t think my lectures would give students any reasonable grounds for inferring my views on current political issues.&rdquo; Professor Robinson adds, however, &ldquo;But there are some classes that are sort of intrinsically political that are not necessarily partisan.... How do you study issues of non-granting of human rights to people and the issue of discrimination without saying &lsquo;And this isn&rsquo;t good!&rsquo;? I suppose this is political.... I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem.&rdquo; Since the Stanford faculty is overwhelmingly liberal, the supposedly non-partisan view presented in such classes may well be debated at large. It would be surprising if IHUM&rsquo;s close kinship with CIV did not cause similar problems of politicization: some tracks are apolitical, while others are politically charged.</p>
		  <p>IHUM&rsquo;s structure reflects the reasons for its creation. The program, as every freshman knows, is divided into two sections: a standalone fall class and a two quarter winter-spring sequence. According to Professor Robinson, &ldquo;The fall quarter especially is meant to build skills in students. All of those [courses] are obligatorily team-taught by two or more professors.... The fall quarter is supposed to expose people to different perspectives on a limited number of texts.... In two quarters, we&rsquo;re hoping that in two quarters, we can give students an in-depth look at one specific disciplinary approach to a specific subject matter.... The idea is first, in fall quarter you get introduced to the notion that there are a lot of perspectives on texts, and you&rsquo;re also helped along in your ability to argue and to write. And then, in winter-spring, you will get specific disciplinary traditions and topics within them.&rdquo; The program&rsquo;s main goals are skill-based; content goals are subsidiary. </p>
		  <p>Opinions vary as to how well IHUM fulfills its goals. The IHUM Program&rsquo;s self-study is self-congratulatory: &ldquo;In the years since 1997-98, the IHUM Program has developed and offered a wide array of courses.... Our extensive course evaluation data indicate that these courses are good (even really exciting) now, and are consistently improving over the years.&rdquo; Later, it cites a study conducted by the Stanford Study on Writing to show that students&rsquo; writing improves through the course of the program; since IHUM encompasses the whole freshmen year, this merely says that Stanford teaches its freshmen well. The report credits, with no evidence beyond the nature of the program, much of this improvement to IHUM, but itself recognizes the vast array of factors that influence student writing. The Program in Writing and Rhetoric and the Writing Center are especially influential. It would be surprising indeed if, in the absence of IHUM, freshmen&rsquo;s writing skills did not improve. There seems to be little concrete evidence that IHUM actually fulfills its skill building goals. </p>
		  <p>Certainly, many students question IHUM&rsquo;s skill building value. Freshman Andrew Hutchinson comments, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t build the argumentative skills that I will need in the future.&rdquo; Freshman Matti Hirpa remarked that the program &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t build skills at all&rdquo; and freshman Andy Schneider described this aspect as &ldquo;mediocre at best.&rdquo; Upperclassmen agree. Sophomore Tyler Bennet said &ldquo;as far as writing goes, it&rsquo;s completely horrible&rdquo; and junior Alexis Marshall concurs: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it built my writing and argumentative skills.&rdquo; It seems fair to say that IHUM&rsquo;s does poorly in engendering skills. </p>
		  <p>In response, the report&rsquo;s cover letter also argues that &ldquo;by the time most students are seniors, they look back and are &lsquo;very glad we had to read those books.&rsquo;&rdquo; And students do seem more satisfied with IHUM&rsquo;s content. Hutchinson argued that the program isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;really that broad or widespread. All the classes seem roughly the same,&rdquo; but most others were positive. Hirpa commented, &ldquo;It exposes me to different areas of the humanities, but I don&rsquo;t know how comprehensive it is,&rdquo; while Bennet said the program introduces students to different areas &ldquo;very well.&rdquo; These comments affirm the success of the program&rsquo;s structure, team-teaching approach, and choice of material. Marshall&rsquo;s observation supports the report&rsquo;s view: &ldquo;It exposed me to books and pieces that I never would have read.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>This raises questions about the program&rsquo;s fundamental philosophy. If, as the report notes, students are grateful for their exposure to great works, then it would seem that a works-based approach along the lines of Western Culture would be more suited to their needs. Norman Book believes that &ldquo;Western Culture built student skills very well&rdquo; in addition to showing them the progression of Western thought. Some people within the program seem ambivalent. Professor Bobonich notes that &ldquo;This approach does have significant advantages and I do regret that many students will leave Stanford without having read what I think of as very important texts and authors&rdquo; but also points out that IHUM better presents great non-Western works and encourages coming scholars to study these texts. Professor Robinson, in contrast, believes the university&rsquo;s values preclude this approach, but that most students are not affected. &ldquo;Is there a core set of readings that everybody should have before they get out of Stanford? The answer we apparently have given to this question in the legislation for IHUM, very much so in CIV as well, is &lsquo;Guess not.&rsquo; ... Is it possible to get out of Stanford in four years without having read some of the classics of Western literature? It&rsquo;s hard, but it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>Student&rsquo;s should not expect change. The program&rsquo;s self study rejects the great work approach that students seem to value in favor of the defunct skills-based approach: &ldquo;We are certainly not intending to suggest that we should return to a canon of the great western thinkers.... We are also not suggesting that we should substitute a multicultural canon for the Eurocentric one.... We do think that the current Area One Program has the right focus for equipping students to live in a multicultural world: teaching analytic skills, critical abilities, habits of mind rather than specified content.&rdquo; Professor Robinson explains this reasoning, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve moved so far away from the privileged position of Western Civilization and its texts in all the different humanistic disciplines that it would be impossible to get people to agree on a canonical core of texts.... Even though, say in 1950, there was still a well-understood core, it left out a lot of interesting texts, even in the Western tradition.... There was a process of exclusion already going on even when people were thinking about Western Civilization courses&rdquo; that would appear even more exclusionary in today&rsquo;s multicultural climate.</p>
		  <p>It is surprising that an institution as prestigious and diverse as Stanford neglects its students&rsquo; academic desires in favor of an ineffective skill building program. Most of IHUM&rsquo;s value comes from what is left of its roots in the Western Culture program: students value exposure to great works, Western or not. The program&rsquo;s materials and structure are well chosen, but it could fulfill students&rsquo; needs better if it shifted its focus from skills to texts. This would also reverse the program&rsquo;s politicization. A return to Western Culture may not be feasible, but a return to its approach is warranted.</p>
