		  <p>It&rsquo;s finally over &ndash; or is it? Nineteen different judges have upheld Terri Schiavo&rsquo;s right to die. However, no amount of legal or medical evidence has staunched the flow of rhetoric about &ldquo;forced euthanasia.&rdquo; Her death may not obviate the need to combat this scaremongering with facts.</p>
		  <p>The first question we need to ask is whether Terri Schiavo&rsquo;s death is news. Legally, Terri died on March 31, but practically speaking nothing changed on that day. All of the evidence says that she has been gone for a long time. This case was only a matter of life and death to the extent that opponents of euthanasia made it so.</p>
		  <p>Schiavo has been in a Persistent Vegetative State since 1991. A diagnosis of PVS, or cortical death, indicates an irreversible loss of cognitive function. In Terri&rsquo;s case, this was a result of massive brain damage following a cardiac arrest. CT scans performed in 2001 confirmed that her cerebral cortex had been destroyed and replaced with cerebrospinal fluid. Her EEG was flat, indicating a lack of cortical activity. It is not possible for a &ldquo;person&rdquo; with no cortex to regain consciousness in any meaningful sense. Thus, her diagnosis makes any suggestion that she might have wanted to live moot.</p>
		  <p>Terri&rsquo;s parents, the Schindlers, have understandably found this diagnosis difficult to accept and have argued that MRI and PET scans should have been ordered. Could those tests have changed her diagnosis? First, MRI provides the same anatomical information as a CT scan. The difference in resolution is not especially relevant to determining whether someone has a large hole in her head. Secondly, PVS is diagnosed primarily on the basis of clinical tests. None of these scans is a necessary part of a diagnosis, though they can help confirm it. &ldquo;I am not sure if she had an MRI, or CT, in this case it doesn&rsquo;t matter much,&rdquo; says David Tong, an Associate Professor of Neurology at Stanford Medical Center. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any data that substantiate using PET for this diagnosis.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>Dr. Tong added that &ldquo;99% of physicians would say she has no chance at any meaningful cognitive life, whether you call it PVS or anything else. The rest are probably not credible, or have another agenda.&rdquo; In fact, every doctor who has treated her over the past 15 years and all six court-appointed physicians concur with the original diagnosis. Only two doctors, both of whom were appointed by the Schindlers, have failed to confirm this diagnosis upon examining her. Of these, one is not a neurologist, and the other, William Hammesfahr, is widely considered a &ldquo;promoter of questionable methods&rdquo; (details can be found at www.quackwatch.com). During the trial, Hammesfahr falsely claimed that he had been nominated for a Nobel Prize, although none of his work has ever been published in a peer-reviewed academic journal. </p>
		  <p>Clearly, experts are not divided on this issue. But isn&rsquo;t it always best to &ldquo;err on the side of life?&rdquo; I do think pro-tube activists have erred, but not on the side of life. Sadly, Terri Schiavo never had a chance at life by any reasonable definition. But let us suppose for the sake of argument that somehow there was some small chance that she would eventually have recovered some level of cortical function. I think Judge Greer would have made exactly the same decision, and quite rightly.</p>
		  <p>As far as anyone knows, Terri did not wish to be sustained on life support in the first place. Some have argued that removing her feeding tube without &ldquo;proof beyond all reasonable doubt&rdquo; is equivalent to delivering a death sentence without due process. But these people are the first to observe that Schiavo had no living will, so the matter can never be proven, and no one will ever be in a better position to judge. How can anyone advocate postponing this decision any further, pending unattainable proof, when it has been legally established that this would violate her wishes? Unless she actually did recover, this would mean artificially (and illegally and unethically) sustaining her in a vegetative state indefinitely. </p>
		  <p>Now suppose, just for the sake of argument, that the Schindlers were correct that she did have some sort of &ldquo;low-level consciousness.&rdquo; Since PVS patients have no awareness, this is a necessary assumption if we are to entertain the notion that removing Terri&rsquo;s feeding tube was inhumane. But this only compounds the hypocrisy of using her as a poster child against euthanasia when &ldquo;in theory, her doctors could put a solution in her IV drip that would end her life peacefully, painlessly and quickly.&rdquo; (Radley Balko, FOX news) </p>
		  <p>The available evidence says that Terri would rather die than exist in a nonconscious state for a minute. Why assume she would have wanted to continue lying in a semiconscious state after 15 years? Who would sentence her to a fate worse than death with no evidence? Of course, it&rsquo;s the same people who feel we can&rsquo;t let her die based on the same evidence. </p>
		  <p>There is, however, no reason to doubt that both of those assumptions are false. Ultimately, this is an artificial controversy, and the real question is the motive of the manufacturers. This is more than a matter of ideology. George Greer is a self-professed religious conservative, but he proudly refuses to let politics interfere with his judgments. There are, however, politicians of the same ideological stripe who want to exploit Terri for political gain.</p>
		  <p>Remarkably, these people paint themselves as the defenders of morality, limited government and &ldquo;the will of the American people.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s unusual about this case was that they had the &ldquo;moral clarity&rdquo; to violate all three of these principles at once, i.e., to legislate their way around individual court rulings when they didn&rsquo;t like the outcome, even though 82% of Americans think it&rsquo;s none of the government&rsquo;s business. Courageous? Maybe. Compatible with federalism? No. Terri Schiavo&rsquo;s death is old news, and it should have been a family matter. The real tragedy here is that these people will no doubt continue to exploit her memory and redouble their efforts to control how all of us live and die.</p></td>
