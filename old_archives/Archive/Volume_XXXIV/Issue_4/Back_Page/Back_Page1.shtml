		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>1. Economics 101: Economic Policy Analysis</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: David Johnson</em></p>
		  <p>This course is one of Stanford&rsquo;s rare gems &ndash; a history of economic thought, not to be confused with economic history. Dr. Johnson has developed this course around the PBS documentary The Commanding Heights, which is based on the eponymous book The Commanding Heights. The course begins with the battle of ideas between economists John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich August von Hayek. You know a course is good when the course description prominently features Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises. The never-dull Dr. Johnson is a phenomenal instructor, despite his liberal political leanings, who cares very much about his students. ECON 101 is the Economics department &ldquo;writing in the major&rdquo; course. Be prepared for lots of writing, including a 20-25 page term paper. The prerequisites are steep so if you cannot take the course, the next best alternative is Economics 1: Principles of Economics. Unfortunately this spring is the last time that this particular course will be offered by Dr. Johnson because he and his family are moving to the East coast. The students of Wellesley College will be lucky to receive this talented instructor.</p>
		  <p><strong>2. Philosophy 132: Existentialism</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Lanier Anderson</em></p>
		  <p>This class deals with the most interesting field of philosophy: the way we should live our lives. Twice during lectures, the professor explained the material in such a way that he brought several students to tears, and there was a standing ovation after the lecture. The readings are from people like Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Sartre and they are difficult. For example, &ldquo;The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self.&rdquo; Yup, that is what you will be reading, but it is well worth it in the end (sniff, sniff).</p>
		  <p><strong>3. Biological Sciences 150: Human Behavioral Biology</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Robert Sapolsky</em></p>
		  <p>To say that Robert Sapolsky is a great storyteller would be an understatement, as anyone who has read his books knows. He is engaging, dynamic, entertaining, approachable, and indisputably one of the best lecturers at Stanford. The class offers a survey of many approaches to human behavior, such as ethology, sociobiology, and molecular genetics. In the second half of the class, Sapolsky attempts to integrate these different perspectives and apply them to specific behaviors, including parenting, religion, and schizophrenia. The class offers some astonishing insights into the human condition and the second segment particularly should be of interest to anyone. Sapolsky does a great job of making this class accessible to non-majors, so no one has any excuse not to take this class.</p>
		  <p><strong>4. Political Science 245S: Islam and the West</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Abbas Milani</em></p>
		  <p>I highly recommend this course for any interested in hearing an educated, fair opinion on the current conflicts between Islam and Western Civilization. Abbas Milani is an excellent instructor who has a fascinating life story to boot&mdash;having taught English at the University of Tehran both before and after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and having been imprisoned during the time of the Shah. Furthermore, his personal anecdotes on Islamic and Iranian life are as entertaining as they are illuminating, although many involve necessary, if chilling, details. For those of all political persuasions, you&rsquo;ll find a man who doesn&rsquo;t teach with politics in mind. Dr. Milani is not concerned with red or blue when he talks foreign policy, instead he&rsquo;s focused on the overall improvement of Iran and its people. I have no doubt that this course will be an excellent opportunity for those Stanford students interested in pricking the American bubble on perceptions of the Middle-East.</p>
		  <p><strong>5. International Relations 119C: Arms Control and Efforts to Prevent the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Keith Hansen</em></p>
		  <p>This course focuses on the efforts to control and prevent the proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Students participate in a simulated National Security Council briefing and write their own policy recommendations, which are quite fun, informative, and enlightening. The reading is relatively heavy, but all of it is interesting and used in creative ways by the instructor. Professor Hansen is noted for his wealth of knowledge which is derived much from his experience in the field as a member of the US Intelligence Community, and the intensity with which he focuses on the issues. His style of teaching, combined with his qualifications, explains why he is highly-rated by his students and his classes are among Stanford&rsquo;s most recommended.</p>
		  <p><strong>6. Art History 111Y: &ldquo;From Giotto to Michelangelo: Introduction to the Renaissance in Florence&rdquo;</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Timothy Verdon</em></p>
		  <p>Taught by Professor Timothy Verdon, who also happens to be the head priest at the Cathedral in Florence, From Giotto to Michelangelo: Introduction to the Renaissance in Florence is certainly one of the most amazing classes offered by Stanford. Most of the classes meet at museums or churches around Florence to view the artwork and architecture firsthand. Not only is Verdon a respected art historian, but his status as an ordained member of the clergy gives him both a great deal of understanding about the religious nature of much of the Renaissance art and the ability to arrange special viewings of Church collections. While winter students may have to endure the occasional cold and drizzly morning, the fascinating knowledge is well worth the hardship. There is no better place to study the beginnings of the Renaissance than Florence and there could be no better teacher than Verdon.</p>
		  <p><strong>7. Computer Science 106A</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructors: Osvaldo Jimenez and Brandon Burr</em></p>
		  <p>Come embark on an epic journey of object-oriented fun. In this extravaganza you will be aided by an insufferably cute robot, a licensed DJ and an army of devoted section leaders. Lecturers Osvaldo Jimenez and Brandon Burr are young but dynamic, entertaining, and knowledgeable. This class teaches the basics of computation and programming, which are becoming common in many career fields. Programming develops logical thinking skills as well, and the class is accessible to anyone. Some of the projects include games like Yahtzee and much work with graphics is done. Finally, the level of help available from course staff is unmatched in any other large lecture class.</p>
		  <p><strong>8. Economics 116: American Economic History</strong></p>
		  <p><em>Instructor: Gavin Wright</em></p>
		  <p>American Economic History exposes students to the economic history school of thought through the context of US history. Topics include the colonial economy, the transportation revolution, slavery and the Civil War, the global rise of US industry, Great Depression and New Deal, and the high-tech economy. The only prerequisite is ECON 1, and this course satisfies two GERs &ndash; 3b,4b. Although many Area 4 GERs are saturated with dogmatic multiculturalism, this course avoids such politicization and anti-intellectual tendencies. Dr. Wright emphasized this point as he told the class on the first day, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to be cruel and impersonal,&rdquo; but this course is &ldquo;not fundamentally about culture.&rdquo; He said there would not be any special focus on women or racial minorities, although they will be included as part of the larger story of American Economic History.</p>
