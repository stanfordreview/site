		  <p>Among the hate-filled and bitterly ignorant email I received following President Bush&rsquo;s decisive victory in November, one email seems to stand out. It contained two images of the United States. It depicted the electoral- 
		    college breakdown of the recent election superimposed over a map of the Civil-War era confederate states.</p>
		  <p>The email sought to imply that there is a tie between the Republican Party and slaveholders in the 1800s. Never mind that Republicans were responsible 
		      for passing nearly every single piece of civil rights legislation over the past 100 years, it is undeniable that the Democrat Party of 2004 carries a subliminal 
	        message: Republicans are racist. Ever since losing the southern voting constituency in the 60&rsquo;s, Democrats have been forced to look elsewhere for votes. In recent years, where Republicans have worked for &ldquo;equal protection under the law,&rdquo; Democrats have favored de facto racial quotas, racially targeted government entitlements, and various programs reminiscent of the &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; signs of the 60&rsquo;s, merely with reversed roles.</p>
		  <p>Thus, it is no surprise that African-Americans voted roughly eight to one for John Kerry in the recent election, allowing Democrats to perpetuate the myth that Republicans are the party of racist old money elites. Perhaps that is why January 
		      26th was such a devastating day for liberals such as Rachelle Marshall, who recently wrote an op-ed for the Daily entitled &ldquo;Condoleezza Rice&rsquo;s Confirmation 
		      Gives Stanford Nothing to be Proud of.&rdquo; Indeed, on January 26th Condoleezza Rice became the first African- 
		      American to be sworn in as America&rsquo;s 
	        Secretary of State, striking fear into the hearts of liberals everywhere.</p>
		  <p>How could it be that there might be a black woman worthy of such a high honor? Why isn&rsquo;t she standing up against racist white America, demanding reparations, retribution and retaliation? Well, perhaps 
		      it is that she lets her record speak for itself. Frankly, I could care less how much pigment is in Condoleezza Rice&rsquo;s skin. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of liberals and conservatives alike constantly qualifying 
	        Rice as the &ldquo;first African-American&rdquo; anything. Let&rsquo;s look at the facts.All else aside, a good starting place might be to consider Rice&rsquo;s qualifications.</p>
		  <p>I&rsquo;m afraid in this arena liberals 
		      have very little ground to tread on, despite ridiculous assertions from such prominent Democrats as &ldquo;Drunk Uncle&rdquo; Ted Kennedy that Rice is &ldquo;unqualified.&rdquo; Rice graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Denver. She has a Masters 
	        from Notre Dame and PhD from University of Denver in International Relations. She served on Notre Dame&rsquo;s Board of Trustees and on the board of directors of Chevron and Charles Schwab. She is a tenured professor in our own Political Science department. She was the youngest provost Stanford has ever had. She is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. She was Special Assistant to President H.W. Bush for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for Soviet Affairs for the National Security Council. She oversaw the fall of the Berlin Wall and is one of the primary reasons Germany has gone from a socialist hellhole to an economic powerhouse. And, of course, she recently served as National Security Advisor under President Bush.</p>
		  <p>So, with that said, I shall turn my attention to some of the criticisms leveled 
		      at Rice by Senator Boxer and other like-minded and equally inept individuals. 
	        You know what? I actually really like Barbera Boxer. She&rsquo;s managed to provide America with some of the best comic relief the Senate has seen in years. Or, at the very least, has become a crystallized role model in hypocrisy and partisan hackery to the extent that she deserves to be commended. On the one hand, she recently criticized Rice for &ldquo;lying&rdquo; about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.</p>
		  <p>On the other hand, she also stated in 2002 that she believed Iraq had &ldquo;not lived up to its agreement&rdquo; to &ldquo;dismantle all weapons of mass destruction.&rdquo; One might try to escape this apparent contradiction 
		      in pointing out that Boxer&rsquo;s colleagues voted to authorize the war in Iraq based on Condoleezza&rsquo;s falsified claims. But, the counter-argument is obvious and has, in fact, been beaten into the ground. Senators had access to the same sorts of intelligence briefings that Rice did. As it turns out, the reason 
		      America has a separation of powers is precisely so that they will act separately. 
		      Many senators, including John Kerry and Barbra Boxer, came to the conclusion that, based on these briefings, 
	        Iraq possessed WMD. Although Boxer did not vote to authorize force in 2003, she did support bombing Iraq during 1998&rsquo;s Operation Desert Fox on the basis of Iraq&rsquo;s WMD programs.</p>
		  <p>Indeed, if one&rsquo;s conclusion regarding Iraq&rsquo;s WMD programs ought to be a litmus test for whether an individual is suitable for office, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, John Edwards, Hillary Clinton 
	        and Boxer herself should all be impeached tomorrow. How quickly liberals forget that President Clinton claimed Iraq possessed WMD in order to justify bombing in 1998. In fact, perjury prone Bill Clinton was heard repeating the WMD claim as recently as 2004.Perhaps I&rsquo;m missing the point, however.</p>
		  <p>The real matter is that, not only is Boxer&rsquo;s criticism hypocritical, but in some cases she pulls her facts out of thin air. At one point in Boxer&rsquo;s questioning she completely manufactured 
	        the number of war casualties in California. At another point, Boxer claimed the rationale for going to war with Iraq was, according to the resolution, &ldquo;WMD, period.&rdquo; Unfortunately for Boxer, the resolution spells out a number of reasons (nine, in fact) that the liberation of Iraq is justified, including Saddam&rsquo;s &ldquo;brutal repression of [Iraq&rsquo;s] civilian population thereby threatening international peace and security in the region.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>In short, I suggest 
		        that Senator Boxer first evaluate her own integrity before calling the kettle black.There are two questions that ought to be evaluated in considering whether Condoleezza Rice deserves her status as Secretary of State. First, does she possess 
		        the credentials historically required for such a position? Second, does her performance in similar positions indicate 
		        that she would perform well in her current position? I think the answers to both questions are a resounding yes and that Stanford ought to be incredibly 
          proud to be affiliated with such an outstanding woman.</p></td>
