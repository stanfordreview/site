		  <p>America is a nation of liberty. From the signing of the Declaration of Independence, this nation has been dedicated to preserving the collective and individual liberties of all deserving citizens. But far beyond its dedication to liberty, America is distinguished in this world of hate and tyranny and oppression by its absolute resolution to safeguarding the liberties of all individuals, without compromise, discrimination, 
		    or equivocation. At least in America, liberty has never been a euphemism, bandied about by self-justifying 
		    demagogues or rogue dictators intent on fostering a false nationalism.</p>
		  <p>The day that America embraces liberty as mere rhetoric is the day that America no longer exists. American liberty and what has been quaintly referred to as liberty in states of tyranny worldwide differ in one key respect. While certain governments choose to regard liberty as a means to end (and often a means to a political end), Americans understand that liberty is the ultimate end. The Middle Eastern ideologue tells his followers that they need to be &ldquo;free&rdquo; from Western influence &ndash; and in so doing encourages hatred and terrorism. Hitler, I believe, once told a nation of essentially decent people that they needed to be &ldquo;free&rdquo; from the corrupting Jew: extermination followed, with an entire people complicit in genocide. Of course, we can rest safe in our conviction that racial profiling will never slide down that proverbial slippery slope into eruptions of mass slaughter.</p>
		  <p>Advocates of the slippery slope are sitting backwards on the toboggan. But at the very least, current and historical misuses of liberty demonstrate that American values and definitions of liberty are not necessarily universal. Racial profiling is essentially a utilitarian compromise of liberty. There is no question that many terrorists in this world are Arabs, and that African-Americans commit a disproportionate number of crimes, relative to their population. 
	        But denying the liberties of many Americans, with the hope of preventing crimes that have not occurred, is essentially a compromise of liberty. Racial profiling denies innocent Americans their right to equal protection under the laws of this country. It is a fundamental breach of liberty and equality.</p>
		  <p>Very occasionally, we make sacrifices of liberty as Americans that are governed 
		      by basic utilitarian principles; in the case of war, we accept that our brothers and sisters are dying because the liberty of America is being threatened. 
		      We accept such a sacrifice willingly, 
		      of course. But there is a difference: 
		      the domestic War on Terrorism and the War on Drugs bear no relation to World War II or the War in Iraq so far as profiling is concerned. In the theater of war, we kill the enemy: he who is armed and fighting and wearing the badge of the military or the mark of the insurgents. The innocent Iraqi, however, who welcomes 
	        freedom from an oppressive regime, is liberated in good faith. In the War on Drugs, the enemy wears no badge; color is not a uniform.</p>
		  <p>In attempting to win this war, in which we are unable to discriminate between the vast majority of innocent and the small minority of guilty, racial profiling 
		      tragically chooses to discriminate against everyone. The Nazi, we must further recall, chose to participate in World War II because he believed in an ideologically perverted government. He wore his uniform by choice. The Arab-American, 
	        conversely, cannot change his skin color.</p>
		  <p> He did not choose to somehow be associated in the minds of equivocators 
	        with the atrocities of Osama bin Laden. The final troubling distinction that must be made between the wars we hold on battlefields and our so-called Wars on Terrorism and Drugs is that the former conflicts are designed to reach a conclusion.</p>
		  <p>It would be na&iuml;ve to suggest that America will completely 
		      eliminate the trafficking of illegal drugs; it would be equally na&iuml;ve to believe that America will successfully neutralize Islamic hatred. When policymakers 
		      prophesy an end to the War on Terrorism, they prophesy a network of security so comprehensive that it anticipates 
		      potential terrorist attacks before they occur. In other words, the actual discrimination implicit in the War on Drugs or the War on Terrorism will never reach its conclusion. Perhaps we, as Americans, could tolerate a suspension 
	        of liberties if we could reasonably suspect that we were facing a grave and legitimate threat.</p>
		  <p>But we should never tolerate a denial of such liberties for an indeterminate and potentially infinite length.In the midst of World War II, the Supreme Court decided to allow the continued internment of Japanese Americans on the pacific coast of the United States under the pretext that, as descendents of Japan, they were traitors 
	        of this nation and posed a threat. Today, we condemn such a spineless approach to individual liberties.</p>
		  <p>Yet now, over sixty years later, we encounter 
		      the risk of making another similar mistake.It is our responsibility, as Americans, 
	      to embrace liberty for liberty&rsquo;s sake and to accept no compromise in its name. We will be better, and freer, for it.</p></td>
