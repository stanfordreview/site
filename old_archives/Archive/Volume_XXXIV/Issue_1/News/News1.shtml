		  <p>The Roosevelt Institution is perhaps the only think-tank ever to be launched with a joke about butter. And not even a good joke at that. But all jokes aside, when Quinn Wilhelmi, Director of the Development Committee and overall second-in-command, told us on February 
		    8th that &ldquo;the butter is in our pockets,&rdquo; 
		    we most definitely listened. It&rsquo;s a hopeful message. The youth &ndash; we, the disenfranchised future of America &ndash; can make a difference. It was a hopeful launch. Manicured with a smile to match. Bottles of Martinelli&rsquo;s, 
		    that delicious non-alcoholic cider. A beautiful slideshow with occasionally 
		    operational PowerPoint.</p>
		  <p> It&rsquo;s a hopeful ideology. Goals of effecting change and offering &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; 
		      values to the consciousness of Joe Congressman. Maybe even Hillary President. Non-partisan, non-affiliated, open and free discourse from all political 
	        backgrounds and viewpoints. Wait. Non-partisan? Well, of course.</p>
		  <p>The Institution&rsquo;s president, Kai Stinchcombe, isn&rsquo;t also the president of the Stanford Democrats &ndash; at least not anymore. Non-affiliated? Well, yes, at least officially, although I think I saw a Kerry-Edwards sign stuffed into the bottom drawer of the podium. Open and free discourse? Without a doubt. Unless, perhaps you sympathize with the Hoover Institution&rsquo;s &ldquo;right-wing nonsense.&rdquo;The Roosevelt Institution is the &ldquo;nation&rsquo;s first student think-tank.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p> It was founded at Stanford, but is already operational at Yale and will soon be spreading its policy wings at &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of schools across the country. Its mission is simple but surprisingly revolutionary. Get &ldquo;student ideas into the public discourse,&rdquo; because &ldquo;our intellectual capital is an underutilized asset.&rdquo; The Roosevelt Institution is intended to be welcoming, inclusive. </p>
		  <p>As Stinchcombe told his audience repeatedly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not about Democrats and Republicans.&rdquo; The Roosevelt Institution&rsquo;s freshly-drafted &ldquo;proposed constitution&rdquo; is doubtless expected to act as a reaffirmation 
		      of this image of inclusiveness. Clause four of the first section reads, dramatically: &ldquo;The organization has no political affiliation. We share no ideology 
		      but the affirmation that humanity 
	        can use policy as a tool to better achieve its common purposes.&rdquo; This policy is to be formulated in fourteen vehicles, the committees of the Institution. </p>
		  <p>They include the &ldquo;Committee on Education and Learning,&rdquo; 
		      the Committee on Economic Opportunity,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Committee on Progressive Religious Perspectives,&rdquo; a virtual smorgasbord of delicious discussion 
		      possibilities that have &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; 
		      salivating. And as Quinn told the drooling audience, 
		    &ldquo;we are smart and we know it.&rdquo; And indeed, there&rsquo;s no reason not to believe that the Roosevelt Institution could make a difference. The question is, however, what sort of difference the Institution is set on making. </p>
		  <p>Clues can be found by digging slightly below the surface. Underneath a non-partisan, inclusive shell, a yolk of liberalism is being protected by the white-innocent youth. Kai Stinchcombe is persuasive and approachable, a fitting ambassador for the Institution. He speaks well to a crowd; he is articulate and often eloquent. He has a sense of humor. He seems like a genuinely nice guy. But Kai Sinchcombe does lack bi-partisan credibility. He was a passionate 
		      president for the Stanford Democrats, and was praised by his friend and deputy, Wilhelmi, for leading 
	        a successful living wage campaign at Colorado College.</p>
		  <p>Just before the launch of the Roosevelt Institution, he wrote an article for the Stanford 
		      Daily, entitled &ldquo;What kind of conservative are you?&rdquo; in which he attempted to classify the various sorts of campus heathen. (For the record, conservatives could be either &ldquo;whiners,&rdquo; &ldquo;charismatic cons,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hell-raisers.&rdquo; 
		      I&rsquo;d have to call myself a charismatic 
		      con, verging on hell-raiser.) More troubling, Mr. Stinchcombe has a history of being more divisive than inclusive. While he welcomes the intelligence of the Hoover fellows, he also criticizes their &ldquo;right-wing propaganda&rdquo; 
	        and belittles their productivity.</p>
		  <p> &ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; he once wrote, &ldquo;it will only take about three students working 
		      five hours a week to systematically rebut all the nonsense Hoover puts out. Stanford, get ready for the Roosevelt 
		      Institution.&rdquo; Wilhelmi was more accommodating: &ldquo;the Hoover Institution is simply outdated,&rdquo; he claimed. Herbert Hoover, of course, the President 
	        who got saddled with a depression and was then criticized for his attempts (in four years) to fix it, is no friend of Kai&rsquo;s.</p>
		  <p> For several minutes the launch of the Roosevelt Institution seemed to be set in the 1930s, as the slideshow navigated 
		      through Hoover-era policy. For all their ambition, it would be difficult to imagine the Roosevelt Institution preventing the Great Depression, you know, it having happened three-quarters 
		      of a century ago. The Roosevelt Institution is intentionally 
	        ambiguous in its name. The Institution website portrays the beautiful mugs of Teddy, Franklin, and Eleanor, and links are available to each of their biographies. </p>
		  <p>But the Institution seems to be nonetheless Franklin-centric. As Stinchcombe judiciously observed, &ldquo;[Franklin] Roosevelt beat Hoover, and not by a little bit &ndash; by a landslide.&rdquo; The biographies, and Stinchcombe, unsurprisingly gloss over the more unseemly characteristics of FDR&rsquo;s presidency. &ldquo;Roosevelt,&rdquo; claimed Stinchcombe, &ldquo;saved the world from fascism.&rdquo; But he has come under considerable 
	        attack from modern critics who suggest that he knew about the Holocaust and did nothing to stop it from happening.</p>
		  <p>He also signed Executive 
		      Order 9066, which called for the internment of over 100,000 Japanese Americans who lived on the Pacific Coast because these American citizens &ldquo;posed a threat.&rdquo;Roosevelt is also famous for expanding 
		      government, discouraging investment, 
		      supporting &ldquo;compulsory unionization,&rdquo; 
		      and raising taxes. Clear policy objectives, to be sure, but not necessarily 
		      clear non-partisan objectives.So while Stinchcombe beseeched all Stanford students, &ldquo;regardless of your political affiliations,&rdquo; to engage in Roosevelt policymaking, his message 
	        seemed directed at a very defined percentage of campus.</p>
		  <p>Those, in other words, who wanted to fight the &ldquo;debate dominated by the right wing.&rdquo; The Roosevelt Institution has received support, both from students and financial donors. Almost all of the committees have directors and most have several members. That not a single director lists himself as further 
		      to the right than moderate, and many heads worked for the Stanford democrats, is apparently immaterial. Joaquin Hernandez, a sophomore liberal and the director of the Committee 
	        on Race and Immigration, claimed that that the Institution was &ldquo;non-partisan&rdquo; and &ldquo;more liberal just because the campus is more liberal.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p> But to Debashish Bakshi, a freshman 
		      member, the Roosevelt Institution 
		      is &ldquo;liberal and progressive: the two mean essentially the same thing.&rdquo; The committee mission statements 
		      hint at this dichotomy. The Committee on Sexual Orientation is run by a gay rights campaigner and proclaims proudly that &ldquo;whether you&rsquo;re interested in state recognition of transgendered identity, healthcare benefits for gay couples, or laws banning 
	        discrimination based on sexual orientation, everyone&rsquo;s ideas have a place in our center.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>In other words, conservatives not welcome. The Committee on the Media, run by another liberal, claims in its mission statement that &ldquo;Fox News is assiduously undermining ideals about unbiased journalism, and the White House has turned state propaganda 
	        into a blunt instrument.&rdquo; There is no mention of liberal news sources, or Dan Rather-esque blunders.</p>
		  <p> Instead, the Committee has been set up essentially to oppose conservative media. The Roosevelt Institution may not be entirely non-partisan, but it is certainly hopeful that its progressive message will be attractive to potential 
	        donors. To date, Wilhelmi notes, the Institution has been relying on &ldquo;angels with a fuckload of money.&rdquo; They will be pursuing all possible avenues in the future, including &ldquo;looking into foundation money.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>For now, however, Stinchcombe, Wilhelmi, and the rest of the eager Roosevelt-worshippers are content to dream about the future. &ldquo;We have what it takes to make a difference,&rdquo; Stinchcombe offered, in summation. Indeed, we do, us youth. The question 
		      that Stinchcombe should be asking 
		      himself, however, is whether by accepting only the viewpoints of one half of campus, of presenting a non-partisan fa&ccedil;ade but exuding exclusivity, 
	      he is really engaging in the most effective policy discourse. Sometimes the collaborations of unlike minds can create the most creative solutions. Stinchcombe might be well-advised to actively recruit those unlike minds. to oppose conservative media.</p></td>
