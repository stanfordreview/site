		  <p> The Sudanese Ambassador denied the gravity of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur during his visit to the Stanford campus on February 1st. The Tuesday event at Cubberley Auditorium was intended to provide an alternative perspective 
		    to media coverage, featuring Sudanese Ambassador to the United States Khidir Haroun Ahmed and two members of the Give Peace a Chance Coalition, Hodari Abdul-Ali and Rahiel Tesfamariam.</p>
		  <p>It was sponsored by the Muslim Student Awareness Network. Set with an ironic backdrop of portraits 
		      of happy Sudanese citizens, the Coalition presented results of their fact-finding mission to Sudan, and the ambassador spoke of the recent peace treaty ending a multi-decade civil war between the northern and southern regions of Sudan. But in regards to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan (labeled genocide by the American government, among other groups), that has left an estimated 70,000 people dead, the three panel members shared the same perspective: 
	        the Sudanese government plays no role in the making of the crisis.Attempting to shed historical light on the crisis, Ahmed cited the 70-80 ethnic groups that have developed within the region over hundreds of years.</p>
		  <p>Lines between Arab and African ethnicities have blurred through years of interaction, 
		      and many Darfurians see themselves 
		      as both Arabic and African. The current tensions, he said, emerged as a result of competition for scarce resources between the livestock herders and farmers. The region had been for the most part ignored, and the current conflict fired up two years ago in Al-Fashir when rebel groups stormed the airport. Ahmed claims that these so-called African rebel groups &ldquo;created a humanitarian 
	        crisis to attract the international community.&quot;</p>
		  <p> While confirming that humanitarian rights violations were occurring at the hands of the Janjaweed (Arab) armed groups, Ahmed cited the fact that &ldquo;more than 40% of the army [is] drawn from African tribes,&rdquo; and many prominent political leaders in Khartoum are also from these tribes. Ahmed thus denied intent on the part of the government to commit genocide. 
		      Furthermore, he suggested that the international community labeling the crisis a genocide had &ldquo;emboldened rebel groups,&rdquo; protracting the conflict.The panel was adamant in making the debate international rather than domestic, and persisted in condemning 
	        the United States for its interest in the crisis.</p>
		  <p>Ahmed and Abdul-Ali both implied that the abundance of natural resources in Sudan, not the humanitarian 
		      crisis, serves as the impetus for creating 
		      a national response to the actions of the Sudanese government. Abdul-Ali remarked, &ldquo;[Sudan is] rich, and it&rsquo;s strategic,&rdquo; as if to draw a parallel 
	        between the United States invasion of Iraq and its national response to the crisis in Darfur.</p>
		  <p>He told the audience that &ldquo;outside forces that would like to have regime change in Khartoum&rdquo; are focusing the national attention on Darfur while a similar situation is occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In one of the most unpopular comments 
		      of the evening, Abdul-Ali insinuated 
		      that the United States &ldquo;propaganda 
		      played out so well&rdquo; due to racism on the part of the American public. The credibility of the debate was further called into question by statements 
	        from the panel about refugees in neighboring countries.</p>
		  <p>The ambassador 
		      asserted that the conclusion of genocide had been reached after interviewing 
		      refugees in Chad, which was a safe haven for rebel groups. This claim was supported by Abdul-Ali, who said, &ldquo;adults can fake a situation, but&hellip;the kids were not the pictures of the emaciated 
		      people that you see.&rdquo; While the situation in Darfur is a complex and difficult question of muddled ethnic differences, small distinctions, 
	        and ambiguous ties to the government, there is no uncertainty as to whether the crisis in Darfur exists.</p>
		  <p>This suggestion did not sit well with audience members. Hamilton Ulmer, a freshman, noted that &ldquo;the ambassador seemed to give the already-mistrustful audience a disingenuous version of the situation in Sudan.&rdquo; Much as many of his denials and prevarications 
          were very unpopular with the audience, the ambassador did urge many of the same responses that the US government has proposed to the crisis. &ldquo;The government is determined to resolve this conflict peacefully and through negotiations,&rdquo; he claimed.</p></td>
