		  <p> Taras Kuzio, an expert on Ukrainian 
		    politics, spoke February 3rd on Ukraine&rsquo;s recent election in which pro-western candidate Viktor Yushchenko defeated Moscow-supported Viktor Yanukovych. Yushchenko, who pledges to court NATO and EU membership while fighting domestic corruption, claimed victory in the December 26 re-run of the election, after Ukraine&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled the second round of balloting 
		    in the first election was invalid due to fraud and corruption in the voting process.</p>
		  <p>In the lead up to the October 31 first round, the charismatic Yushchenko was hospitalized for a month due to dioxin poisoning which caused his face to be scarred and artificially aged. According 
		      to Kuzio, &ldquo;Ukraine itself has no laboratory facilities to make dioxin.&rdquo; An investigation of the poisoning is underway, but many are already pointing 
		      the finger at Russia. In another incident 
		      causing suspicion of Russia, two Russian officers were found outside of Yuschenko&rsquo;s office with plastic explosives 
	        and arrested when he returned to work.</p>
		  <p>Kuzio predicted, &ldquo;This could be a nuclear bomb in relations between the US and Russia, if Russia is found to have exported terrorism to the West.&rdquo;Despite his down time in the clinic, pollsters were predicting Yushchenko&rsquo;s victory by an eight percent margin. The official result, however, was withheld for 10 days and massaged by election officials. When the result was released, Yanukovych led by half a percent, triggering 
	          a second round of balloting.Second round exit polls on November 21 showed Yushchenko in the lead, but the official result gave the victory to Yanukovych by a three percent margin.</p>
		  <p>Tapes from Yanukovych&rsquo;s headquarters were later found, revealing that the margin was decided before the election. Even before the results were announced, Russian President Putin called and congratulated 
		      him. The evidence of fraud was everywhere. First, there was an unrealistic increase of voter turnout between the first and second 
		      rounds, with some precinct reports exceeding ninety-eight percent of the population. Many ballot boxes were found suspiciously stuffed with neatly folded and stacked ballots. The election was further plagued by thuggish police tactics, massive use of absentee ballots, and bribing of election officials. The first citizens to realize that rigging 
	        had occurred and take to the streets were civil society activists.</p>
		  <p>Within days, however, in what became known as the Orange Revolution, approximately one million people committed to protesting on the streets of Kiev. Kuzio emphasized 
		      the high number of protesters, explaining that Ukrainians are usually apathetic when it comes to politics. A popular Ukrainian motto is roughly translated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my problem.&rdquo; In this case, however, the election fraud was so blatant that people went to the streets spontaneously. &ldquo;There is a breaking point in everybody, and the Ukrainians were at that point.&rdquo;In the days that followed, the protesters 
	        blockaded numerous state offices, prompting Parliament to pass a motion of no-confidence in the government. On December 3, the Supreme Court annulled the election results, preparing the way for new elections.</p>
		  <p>The final balloting round on December 
		      26 was carefully watched by thousands 
		      of international observers. When the counting began and Yushchenko immediately took the lead, Yanukovych 
	        lodged four complaints against the election conduct, all of which were struck down by the Supreme Court.</p>
		  <p>On January 11, the election commission 
		      declared Yushchenko the official winner by a margin of almost eight percent. Kuzio described this election as a pivotal moment in Ukrainian history that will determine Ukraine&rsquo;s future domestic and international orientations. 
		      The election, he said, was a &ldquo;clash between cultures,&rdquo; divided over &ldquo;whether Ukraine would follow the European path or the Eurasian path of Putin&rsquo;s managed democracy.&rdquo; According 
	        to Kuzio, &ldquo;Beyond Putin&rsquo;s backing of such an odious candidate, his blatant intervention has discredited the Russian model even more.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p> &ldquo;Since the election, Ukraine&rsquo;s international 
		      image has made a complete 180. It has gone from lying in the mud to this&rdquo; he said showing a slide from Davos, Switzerland, where a crowd representing numerous western democracies gave Yushchenko a standing 
		      ovation. Looking towards the future, Kuzio predicted that Ukraine will find it easier to join NATO than the EU. But now the EU, he said, is in quandary: how do you refuse a leader who, after being poisoned 
		      for the sake of democratic ideals and peacefully leading an Orange Revolution, 
	      is rapidly pursuing westernizing reforms? We will see.</p></td>
