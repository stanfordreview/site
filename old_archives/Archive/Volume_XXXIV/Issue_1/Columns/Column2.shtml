		  <p> So, Black History Month. For people like me, who call themselves conservative, 
		    it&rsquo;s become a time to expropriate Dr. King&rsquo;s &ldquo;content of their character&rdquo; rhetoric and whine about affirmative action, and then wish Black History Month really will be history sometime soon&mdash;all in one breath.</p>
		  <p> I guess I&rsquo;ll whine about affirmative action then, though without claiming Frederick Douglass would agree with me were he alive today.It goes with being a law student, I suppose. I love to argue about what &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;equality&rdquo; require. And yet I also think it&rsquo;s a futile exercise. They mean too many different things to too many different people. Each of those perspectives can be argued from but cannot themselves be argued for. I was initially pleased, then, when the Supreme Court upheld &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; as a compelling enough interest to justify affirmative action in America&rsquo;s elite colleges and universities.</p>
		  <p>Diversity, after all, isn&rsquo;t a philosophical 
		      ideal. It&rsquo;s an empirical one. We may bicker about how it ought to be achieved, and how much of it is enough, but most of us seem to understand 
		      why it&rsquo;s thought to be important. 
		      Alas, diversity is a defense of affirmative action we can work with, even test. One with teeth! But now, I fear, an overbite. Diversity, like tolerance, is another sacrosanct liberal virtue we celebrate without a rich understanding of what its value consists in. It was supposed to be an alternative to a fuzzy ideal. Now diversity is one itself. Its benefits are thought to be apparent, and any request for clarity is regarded as an affront to racial progress.</p>
		  <p>This is a real problem, because unless what diversity 
		      is for is made painstakingly clear, affirmative action can&rsquo;t stand but on wobbly stilts. Some say it&rsquo;s important for a campus, or more precisely a classroom, to represent 
		      our broader society writ small. To see how incoherent this argument is, just take it seriously. How many classmates do you have who didn&rsquo;t graduate from high school? Who is predisposed to crime? Who really did try in high school, but got poor grades and scored horribly on their SATs? Who thinks education is overrated? Most of America is not represented here&mdash;or in Cambridge&mdash;and I doubt we would want it any other way. This is Stanford, lest we ever forget it.</p>
		  <p>A more familiar&mdash;and some would say more hopeful&mdash;argument was Michigan&rsquo;s when it was forced to defend its affirmative action practices: there are great educational benefits to be derived from a diverse student body. Justice O&rsquo;Connor, who bought this argument in Grutter v. Bollinger, put it this way in her opinion. &ldquo;Classroom 
		      discussion is livelier, more spirited, 
		      and simply more enlightening and interesting,&rdquo; she wrote, when students have &ldquo;the greatest possible variety of backgrounds.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>There is some truth to this, but as far as I can see, only a limited amount. For starters, students with identical backgrounds may have anything but identical views. My closest friends in college were pretty much like me: upper class, privately educated, white, suburban, and so on. We never ran out of anything to talk about, and our conversations were constantly heated. Beyond this, there&rsquo;s no great reason to assume someone with a unique background will, because of it, have something unique to say, or else any compulsion to say it. There is even less truth to O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s claim if &ldquo;backgrounds&rdquo; are construed racially, as diversity most often is.</p>
		  <p>I&rsquo;ll just come out and say it: I cannot think of a single reason for saying my classes are any livelier, more spirited, more enlightening, or more interesting simply because there are minority students in them. This isn&rsquo;t to say those students don&rsquo;t contribute, because they absolutely do&mdash;and on par with everybody else. It&rsquo;s simply to say when they do contribute, their contributions are those of a thoughtful person, period. I can&rsquo;t think of a single occasion on which one of their contributions 
		      was remotely identifiable as racially inspired, or not shared by someone of another race.</p>
		  <p>On this note, we ought to seriously ask ourselves whether it&rsquo;s even fair to charge minority students with a responsibility 
		      to speak and offer a different voice, which a dominant understanding of diversity&rsquo;s purpose undeniably does. It strikes me as flagrantly stereotypical and grossly patronizing. It&rsquo;s stereotypical 
		      because it pegs our worldviews to our race. It&rsquo;s patronizing because it implicitly charges underrepresented minorities with a responsibility for &ldquo;showing their diversity.&rdquo; Suppose they don&rsquo;t want to. Suppose they&rsquo;ve got social and intellectual projects of their own. Shouldn&rsquo;t we respect this about them, rather than use them to further some broader educational purpose? White students can spend an entire class period on ESPN.com. </p>
		  <p>Shouldn&rsquo;t black students be able to as well? So where does this leave us? I&rsquo;m really 
		      not sure. In my black friends&mdash;and I consider them among my closest&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see people whose perspectives could never be mine, or whose perspectives 
		      I find particularly enriching. It&rsquo;s actually unbelievable to me how much we have in common. We are all students anxious about our careers, men and women who crave intimacy yet fear it, social creatures who love a well mixed cocktail, and moral agents who struggle constantly to discover and do what is right. </p>
		  <p>Our differences are trivial.It seems to me a better defense of affirmative action might lie here&mdash;not in an account of racial differences we are to learn from but rather in one of similarities we are socially conditioned not to expect. The point, in other words, is not to highlight and learn from one another&rsquo;s differences. It is to learn to get over this notion of racial differences to begin with. Almost all of them are figments of an overly progressive 
		      imagination. I&rsquo;d say it is a compelling 
		      objective, but like everything else I&rsquo;ll ever say, it&rsquo;s just a thought.</p>
