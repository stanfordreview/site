		  <p>The Stanford student body should 
		    remain skeptical of the coming ASSU 
		    elections, on April 6-7, considering the 
		    disaster of last year&rsquo;s race. Most of the 
		    hype surrounding last year&rsquo;s election 
		    involved the inappropriate use of the 
		    Class of 2004 e-mail list to endorse 
		    Mikey Lee. As a result the Undergraduate Senate voted to overturn the 
		    election. However, The Stanford Daily 
		    also reported more misconduct in June, 
		    uncovering nearly $200 of special fee 
		    money that the Black Student Union 
		    (BSU) illegally used to fund Ajani 
		    Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz&rsquo;s 2004 
		    executive campaign. </p>
		  <p>The current Co
		      Chair of the BSU, Michael Brown II, 
		      has assured The Review that &ldquo;nothing 
		      of a similar sort should ever happen 
		      again.&rdquo; Nevertheless, the number of 
		      BSU-affiliates on the Undergraduate 
		      Senate, the funding of events related 
		      to Black Liberation Month, the success 
		      of ethnically-oriented student organization in obtaining general fee money, 
		      and the grotesque size of the BSU&rsquo;s 
		      food budget raise legitimate concerns. </p>
		  <p>Of the fifteen Stanford students 
		      that comprise the Undergraduate Senate, five are currently affiliated&mdash;in 
		      some capacity&mdash;with the BSU. Four 
		      of the five serve on the ASSU Senate 
		      Appropriation Committee, the organization charged with recommending 
		      the amount of money allocated to 
		      Stanford&rsquo;s extracurricular groups&mdash;the 
		      BSU among them. In fact, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Dan Stringer, formerly managed 
		      the BSU&rsquo;s finances. Seeing that the specific allocations of General Fee funding 
		      are not approved by the student body, 
		      many appropriations to student groups 
		      are totally subject to the whims of the 
		      sitting senators. Acknowledging the 
		      seemingly disproportionate representation of the black student body, one 
		      would certainly expect the BSU and 
		      related organizations to have great success in receiving ASSU funding. 
		      In fact, four of the five senators 
		      affiliated with the BSU routinely vote 
		      inline with African American student 
		      organizations. </p>
		  <p>Only Dan Stringer 
		      abstained in the Senate&rsquo;s approval of 
		      the BSU Special Fees budget. Also, 
		      when the Black Liberation Month 
		      student organization (BLM) asked 
		      the Undergraduate Senate to approve 
		      an increase in funding to cover an 
		      abnormally expensive poster, senators 
		      Adrian Boscolo-Hightower and Shani 
		      Fregia (both affiliated with the BSU) 
		      came to the rescue. During the Feb
		      ruary 1 Senate meeting, both clearly 
		      advocated allocating $4 per poster for 
		      the BLM&mdash;a 220 percent increase over 
		      the Senate&rsquo;s official rate of $1.25. The 
		      measure passed, and the BLM received 
		      $1,100 for what Fregia referred to as 
&ldquo;more than just a poster&rdquo; during the 
	        Senate meeting. </p>
		  <p>One might think that 
		      advocating and voting for measures 
		      that directly benefit such organizations 
		      would qualify as a conflict-of-interest. 
		      However, Senator Omar Shakir does 
		      not believe that the five BSU-affiliated 
		      senators are guilty of any wrongdoing. Shakir, who regularly abstains 
		      on votes related to the Muslim Student 
		      Awareness Network (of which he is 
		      the financial officer), acknowledges 
		      that &ldquo;it is not&hellip;a conflict of interest to 
		      follow the policies one believes in, even 
	        if shaped by one&rsquo;s experience.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>At the 
		      same rate, Shakir recognizes the apprehensiveness of the situation: &ldquo;From an 
		      outside perspective, it looks fishy. If I 
		      wasn&rsquo;t a Senator and didn&rsquo;t work with 
		      these people, I would be suspicious. But, as someone that works with them 
		      almost everyday, I know they are honest people who genuinely care about 
		      doing what is best for the student 
		      body.&rdquo; Shakir also mentioned that all 
		      of the five senators approved the BSU&rsquo;s 
		      Special Fee budget after a $10,000 cut, 
		      despite the BSU&rsquo;s disapproval. 
		      Interestingly, several groups, including the BSU, asked for money to fund 
		      events related to &ldquo;Black Liberation 
	        Month.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>Americans traditionally 
		      observe Black Liberation Month (also 
		      called &ldquo;Black History Month&rdquo;) in February, commemorating the leaders of 
		      both the abolitionist and civil rights 
		      movement. Although the importance of celebrating this event is irrefutable, 
		      the budgets of several African-American groups on campus are riddled with 
		      Black Liberation Month expenses. The BSU, the Stanford Black Pre-Law 
		      Society, and the Black Psychology 
		      Association all requested and received 
		      funding for the event. Meanwhile, 
		      another group completely devoted to 
		      the commemoration of the month, 
		      the BLM (the acronym distinguishes 
		      it from the actual month), is on the 
		      General Fees budget this year. Taking 
		      note of all this, one must wonder how 
		      these groups avoid violating the Office 
		      of Student Activities&rsquo; regulation that 
		      groups must &ldquo;demonstrate an unmet 
		      need that is not duplicated by another 
	        student group or campus department.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p> Although neither the financial manager nor president of the BLM responded to inquires from The Review, Brown 
		      provided some insight: &ldquo;During BLM, 
		      it is important for the BSU to have a 
		      presence and put on programming for 
		      the community just as I can see why 
		      the Black Community Services Center 
		      would feel it is important to put on 
		      their own programming, as both are 
		      major institutions. Considering that 
		      Black Liberation Month is a month 
		      long, there is room for multiple groups 
		      to participate and need funding for celebrating Black History Month to the 
		      fullest.&rdquo; 
		      Brown also pointed-out that both 
		      Black Community Services Center 
		      (sponsor of the BLM and an actual 
		      entity of the university) and the BSU 
&ldquo;suffer from inadequate funding.&rdquo; Yet, 
		      the BSU received over 95 percent of its 
		      full funding request ($28,560) in Special 
	        Fee money this year&mdash;before refunds. </p>
		  <p>Although the BLM requested $6,000 
		      from the General Fee fund (the maximum allowed), it only received $2,886. However, this amount is rather exorbitant considering it covers funding for 
		      275 four-dollar posters. Meanwhile, 
		      the Stanford Black Pre-Law Society 
	        obtained $941 in General Fee money for its &ldquo;BLM Program&rdquo; and the Black Psychology Student Association received over $177 for similar events. </p>
		  <p>Overall, Stanford organizations spent over $6200 of student body money on Black Liberation Month expenses. However, by splitting the expenses among several groups, each allocation appears insignificant. Additionally, black-oriented student organizations receive the largest share of General Fee funding that goes towards ethnic-themed student organizations. 
		      A study done by The Review of General Fee appropriations before January 11, 2005, found that Black-oriented 
		      student groups receive 41 percent of the general fee money that goes to ethnic-themed student organizations. This is from data collected before the Senate allocated money to the BLM or Black Psychology Student Association 
	        on February 1. </p>
		  <p>Yet, only ten percent of Stanford undergraduates are African Americans. The Review identified 
		      groups as &ldquo;ethnic-themed&rdquo; if their activities primarily served a specific race. Dance groups, service-oriented groups, fraternities, and sororities were not designated as &ldquo;ethnic-themed.&rdquo; These ethnic-oriented groups in general 
		      are more successful at obtaining 
	        their budget requests than other groups. While ethnic organizations garnered 74 percent of their original budget requests, the average General Fee group only received 57 percent. </p>
		  <p>Although there are certainly a variety of factors influencing the success of a budget request, the large discrepancy is certainly striking.The BSU has not experienced the same success in the Special Fee arena. As Shakir noted, the Senate cut the BSU&rsquo;s requested Special Fees budget by a significant amount. However, the BSU successfully petitioned the student body and will be balloted for its original 
	        request of $34,555. It is important to note that the Senate&rsquo;s cut was largely the result of excessive food expenses. </p>
		  <p>The BSU allocated $19,605, or over 56 percent, of their budget for food. Two dinners, the Soul Food Dinner and Kwanzaa Celebration, are funded at $17.50 per person&mdash;more than double the ASSU&rsquo;s accepted rate of $8 per person. 
	        Additionally, the BSU asked for over $13 per attendee for its Freshman Convocation.</p>
		  <p>Nevertheless, Brown came to the defense of appropriating large amounts for food: &ldquo;Cultural groups tend to use more money for food, whereas publications 
		      use money to print publications, and other special fee groups spend a large amount on materials for highly specialized 
		      equipment. In the past years food has become a political buzz word and much rhetoric has sought to make it need justification. 
		      The Black Student Union puts on programs I&rsquo;m really proud of and we get the best prices we can for food at our major cultural events.&rdquo;Students will have a chance to voice their own opinions regarding the BSU&rsquo;s food costs, Special Fees, ASSU senators, 
		      and Class Presidents by voting at ballot.stanford.edu this week. Five candidates for the ASSU Senate will be running that retain some type of affiliation 
	      with the BSU: Brittany Clark, Joslyn Massengale, Macarrin Morton, Krystle Shoate, and Dan Stringer.</p></td>
