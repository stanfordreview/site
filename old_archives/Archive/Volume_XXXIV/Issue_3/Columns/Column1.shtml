		  <p>One of the greatest attributes of 
		    Stanford University is the plethora of 
		    voluntary student organizations that 
		    enrich the campus community. Yet 
		    Stanford&rsquo;s treatment of student publi
		    cations, including The Stanford Review, 
		    has been less than cordial. After a series 
		    of controversial articles about MEChA 
		    published by The Review in 2003, some 
		    houses began to enforce a latent Resi
		    dential Education 
		    (ResEd) policy, 
		    which bans door
		    to-door distribution. 
		    Stanford&rsquo;s dis
		    tribution policy 
		    is set by ResEd, 
		    and the default is 
		    a ban on door-to
		    door distribution, 
		    but &ldquo;each house, 
		    under the guid
		    ance of their Resident Fellow [RF] or 
		    College Director may modify the stan
		    dard policy.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>The impetus for the ban on door
		      to-door distribution was an effort by 
		      some students to censor the content of 
		      student publications. According to an 
		      article published in The Stanford Daily, &ldquo;&lsquo;There is certain sensitive content in 
		      publications that we don&rsquo;t think resi
		      dents should have to deal with in their 
		      rooms,&rsquo; said Roble resident assistant 
		      Kevin Holmes, a senior.&rdquo; Not surpris
		      ingly, Roble was one of the first dorms 
		      to crack down on the free distribution 
		      of student publications to individual 
		      rooms last year. 
		      The reasons 
		      for banning 
		      door-to-door 
		      distribution 
		      have evolved 
		      to include 
		      safety and 
		      environmen
	        tal concerns.</p>
		  <p> West Florence 
		      Moore&rsquo;s RF 
		      Patrick Young 
		      allowed his 
		      dorm staff to 
		      vote on the 
		      policy at the 
		      beginning of 
		      the school 
		      year, but 
		      residents were 
		      not consulted. 
		      Young consid
		      ers door-to
		      door distribution of student 
		      publications 
		      to be a &ldquo;safety 
		      hazard&rdquo; because there is some probability that someone might &ldquo;slip&rdquo; on a 
		      publication if it is placed in front of a 
		      door in a dorm hallway. 
		      Young further argues that door
		      to-door distribution of publications 
		      imposes negative externalities on dorm 
		      residents. When students do not pick 
		      up the publications promptly after 
	        they are delivered to their doors, the hallways become cluttered. Although, 
		      it is not clear that this bothers most 
	        students.</p>
		  <p>Publications that clutter the 
		      hallways impose an additional burden 
		      on the custodians, who must clean up 
		      the leftover publications. A simple 
		      solution to this problem would be for 
		      dorms to allocate some of their funds 
		      to compensate custodians at the begin
		      ning of the 
		      year, assum
		      ing they 
		      believe the 
		      custodians are 
		      not already 
		      paid enough 
		      to clean up 
		      the hallways. 
		      Student 
		      publications 
		      also provide 
		      a positive 
		      e xternality 
		      by fostering 
		      community 
		      at Stanford 
		      in the spirit 
		      of residential 
	        education.</p>
		  <p> However, 
		      students are 
		      hindered by 
		      the decentral
		      ized design 
		      of Stanford&rsquo;s 
		      residences in 
		      receiving student publications. The 
		      primary alternative to door-to-door 
		      distribution is distribution to dorm 
		      lounges, but lounges serve as woe
		      fully inadequate points of distribu
		      tion. Students do not know when to 
		      expect new publications to arrive due 
		      to unpredictable publication patterns 
		      and long intervals between publication 
		      dates. Stanford students are very busy people, and it is not their custom to 
		      actively seek out low-visibility non
		      daily publications. Many students are 
		      not even aware of the existence of some 
		      small publications. Unless publications 
		      are distributed directly, many students 
		      will not see them at all and will not 
		      even have a chance to decide whether 
		      they want to read the publications. 
		      Door-to-door distribution is a 
		      courtesy to students that solves these 
	        problems. </p>
		  <p>When a publication arrives 
		      at students&rsquo; doors, students who might 
		      never have thought they were interest
		      ed in the publication or a topic within 
		      the publication may find themselves 
		      casually perusing its pages and learning 
		      a great deal. 
		      Door-to-door distribution is the best 
		      way of ensuring freedom of the press 
		      on campus, as it facilitates the shar
		      ing of ideas and creative expression 
		      throughout the community efficiently 
		      and allows potential new readers and 
		      contributors to discover their interest 
		      in publications within the realistic con
		      straints of daily life on campus. 
		      Chair of the ASSU Senate Admin
		      istration and Rules Committee, Chris 
		      Nguyen, proposed an advisory refer
		      endum to allow students to voice their 
		      opinion on the matter of door-to-door 
	        distribution. </p>
		  <p>The referendum asks if 
		        students support an opt-out policy for 
		        door-to-door distribution, in which the 
		        default policy for student publications 
		        would be to allow door-to-door distri
		        bution, unless dorms vote to opt-out. 
		        Though not ideal, this measure would 
		        move the policy in the right direction 
		        and significantly improve the status 
		        quo. Free speech at Stanford requires 
		        a reasonable outlet for publications to 
		        reach students, and currently door-to
		        door distribution is the only effective 
          way of accomplishing this goal.</p></td>
