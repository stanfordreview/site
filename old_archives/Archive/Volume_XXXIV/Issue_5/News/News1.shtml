								<p> On Monday, April 11, environmen&shy;tal and social activists from Stanford and the neighboring community heard testimony on &ldquo;The State of Environ&shy;mentalism to Come.&rdquo; Former Sierra Club President Adam Werbach and consultant Michael Shellenberger are practiced in the art of inspiring the youth, mostly via the strength of their life stories. Presenting a surprisingly critical analysis of the movement that they have helped to shape, these men spoke to an audience populated with activists of the future. In an anecdote, Werbach reminded the attendees of the love of natural beauty that had likely brought them all to support the same cause. The two speakers had recently been climbing up the steep, grueling terrain of Lost Trail near Fern Creek waterfalls, only to discover a busy road at the top. The bitterness this inconsistency brought to their day was nothing, however, compared to the frustration they have encountered investigating the reality of eco-politics, an area in which they have both spent their professional lives. </p>
								<p> Michael Shellenberger is the presi&shy;dent of Lumina Strategies, a commu&shy;nications consulting firm, and the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank that seeks to develop strategies for comprehensive global social and envi&shy;ronmental reform. In October 2004, along with Ted Norhaus, president of polling and strategic consulting firm Evan/McDonough, Michael published &ldquo;The Death of Environmentalism,&rdquo; an essay that continues to incite the environmental community. Shellen&shy;berger acknowledged that they &ldquo;broke the number one rule&rdquo; of &ldquo;telling the funders the truth about the state of the movement.&rdquo; After interviewing 25 of the most influential environmental leaders from around the world, they presented their findings to the Envi&shy;ronmental Grantmakers Association. Self-proclaimed as &ldquo;controversial and provocative,&rdquo; they suggest a revolt within the ranks, a move away from environmentalism as a special interest. </p>
								<p> An author and strategist for many years, Adam Werbach serves as Execu&shy;tive Director of the Common Assets Defense Fund, which mobilizes citizens to act on behalf of the community. They posit a common responsibility for the &ldquo;democratic political system, roads and parking spaces, landscapes and soundscapes, wilderness and wild animals, our monetary and financial sys&shy;tems, our store of scientific knowledge, our languages and cultures, the Internet and many more.&rdquo; This collectivist approach guides the policy positions of CADF and suggests that government incurs responsibility to support both economic growth and healthy ecosys&shy;tems. Recently joining the efforts of Shellenberger and Norhaus to revive progressive politics, Adam authored the speech &ldquo;Is Environmentalism Dead?&rdquo; and will present it in Ohio, Minnesota, West Virginia, and Virginia during his April speaking tour. </p>
								<p> The Apollo Alliance joined the ideas of Werbach, Shellenberger, Norhaus, and other enthusiastic facilitators to form theoretically feasible solutions for a new sustainable ecology and economy. Agreeing that independence from for&shy;eign oil is the most important goal for this generation, the Apollo Alliance utilizes support from labor unions, businesses, the Sierra Club, and the National Resource Defense Council, among others, to push for job creation and innovation. Eventual benefits from the Alliance&rsquo;s proposed $300 billion public and private investments include diversified energy sources for the future, cheaper energy, and a large market for American durable goods. In 2004, Apollo gained 20,000 members, par&shy;ticipated in the Democratic Convention, presented to the House Committee on Resources Oversight Hearing on Energy Supply, presented elected leaders with a petition of 100,000 signatures to demand accountability in energy policy, and pro&shy;duced job estimates for each state, total&shy;ing 3 million. </p>
								<p> The newly formed Roosevelt Institu&shy;tion, specifically, the Committee for Environment and Energy, sponsored the round-table discussion. The Stan&shy;ford-based progressive think tank cut the ribbon this past February and has since spawned branches at Yale, Columbia, Middlebury College, and Wheaton Col&shy;lege. Each school hosts an administra&shy;tive staff and issue-driven committees, of which Stanford has 12. Introducing the event, Director for Environment and Energy Ben Grant stressed the &ldquo;par&shy;allels&rdquo; between the professional lives of the speakers and the aims of the Roos&shy;evelt Institution. The professed goals of Roosevelt include &ldquo;discussion groups for individual work, project teams for collec&shy;tive efforts, education centers to inform students about issues they might not explore otherwise, and networking tools to give students access to on-campus and off-campus resources that will be valuable in affecting the political process.&rdquo; The opportunities that Roosevelt provides students are an invaluable part of training for what many see as their duty to serve society. </p>
								<p> Shellenberger began by giving a synop&shy;sis of the movement now called environ&shy;mentalism. Environmentalists of the late 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s &ldquo;should be proud&rdquo; of increasing public awareness, forming the Environmental Protection Agency, and passing the Clean Water and Air Acts. However, he warned against retaining these predecessors&rsquo; ingrained ideas for change, which often involve &ldquo;overly tech&shy;nical&rdquo; solutions. The isolated problems of the flower-power heyday were the &ldquo;low hanging fruit&rdquo; of the dangers facing eco&shy;systems - for instance, one polluted river or smog in Los Angeles. This is nothing compared to the accumulated hazards the world now faces: namely, carbon emis&shy;sions, over-fishing, habitat destruction, and species extinction. Shellenberger claims that finding long-term solutions will require a holistic approach to the &ldquo;organization of human life,&rdquo; not just the championing of pet causes. </p>
								<p> Both men pegged the &ldquo;separation of man from nature&rdquo; in capitalistic Western society as the root hindrance to envi&shy;ronmental progress and the main source of problems that face the ranks of eco-advocates. They argue that most people consciously or unconsciously perceive humans as agents and &ldquo;the environment&rdquo; as the medium through which humans act. United States culture in general, by ignoring the truth that &ldquo;we are all interconnected,&rdquo; follows a &ldquo;dog-eat-dog&rdquo; mentality in which efforts to better : alienation, exclusion, and acceptance of violence. The insistence on personal gain with Therefore, referring to &ldquo;the environment&rdquo; perpetuates this idea of separation. Likewise, &ldquo;environmental&shy;ism&rdquo; creates a narrow focus and ensures that the public perception of the cause is that of just another special interest. </p>
								<p> To move past a constricted definition of environmentalism, Werbach and Shel&shy;lenberger repeatedly stressed the need to become &ldquo;wedded to&rdquo; a values based, comprehensive vision. They suggest that it must remain free of political party affiliations but include a deep understand&shy;ing of the political playing field and the interests of other groups. To develop sustainable economies for all parts of the world while preserving habitats and combating observed global warming, the general public will have to realize that environmental policy does not fit in a &ldquo;box&rdquo; of legislation initiatives but affects their daily life in numerous ways. </p>
								<p> One passionate public arena that does not yet embrace environmentalism as it stands is dogmatic religion, which has not yet joined environmentalism in any gen&shy;eral sense. Nature and any higher power are certainly related, and Shellenberger recalled the aforementioned hike that was definitely in the realm of the Divine. He hesitantly questions the importance of other religious issues, like partial birth abortion, in light of the division they create between left and right regarding protection and preservation. </p>
								<p> Collectively, the &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; movement does not now carry social justice and economic policies as a prior&shy;ity either, Shellenberger concludes. The Apollo Alliance, still &ldquo;but a dream,&rdquo; is an example of unifying progressives behind the goals they share. Instead of concen&shy;trating on science - pollution regulation for corporations and increased fuel effi&shy;ciency - these activists push for research and development in products that create sustainable jobs and build eco-friendly markets. Shellenberger suggests that gov&shy;ernment play a role in facilitating a tran&shy;sition that allows for economic growth. He identified the &ldquo;initial dream&rdquo; of John Kerry taking a harsh stance on the environment, though he and Werbach both laughed at the notion of efficacy of the ecological side of his campaign. Though the 2004 Democratic presiden&shy;tial candidate claimed to be a supporter of the natural world, Shellenberger accused Kerry of providing only half of the talk and none of the action. </p>
								<p> The nature of political language should not be &ldquo;conflict oriented,&rdquo; sug&shy;gested Doctoral Student Jason Funk. He pointed out examples of fear-build&shy;ing: &ldquo;red vs. blue states, freedom vs. terrorism, us vs. them.&rdquo; Conserva&shy;tives, Funk claimed, have &ldquo;captur[ed] the national dialogue,&rdquo; while liberals&rsquo; &ldquo;inclusive language&rdquo; is no match for instilling fear. In a later interview, Funk concluded, &ldquo;If progressives can break down the message of fear, I think we can regain national attention. And I think the usefulness of the message for conservatives is nearly at an end.&rdquo; </p>
								<p> Participants asked about the rela&shy;tionship between humans and the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; as a source of usable materials, intimately involved with fis&shy;cal policy. When asked about the role of the economy, Werbach responded the &ldquo;the economy should work for us; we shouldn&rsquo;t work for the economy; and we&rsquo;ve lost sight of that principle.&rdquo; David Cole, also in the audience, insisted the economy is a subsidiary of the environment, though he cyni&shy;cally acknowledged the prevalence of the opposite view, that humans can &ldquo;take&hellip;infinitely&rdquo; from the environ&shy;ment to suit their needs. </p>
								<p> Roosevelt member Lyuba Wolf concluded the panel discussion by asking for concrete tactics that would further the shared progressive goals of those in attendance. Adam Werbach, the youngest Sierra president at 23, demanded that the young activists of today visualize a country that they would like to inhabit, and &ldquo;get ambi&shy;tious!&rdquo; He presented an example of the Heritage Foundation, whose founders were only 29 at its founding, along with the &ldquo;reconstitution of the Right.&rdquo; Shallenberger encouraged a flourishing intellectual culture, which is now miss&shy;ing from the Left, he says. &ldquo;Question anything anyone over 40 tells you,&rdquo; said Werbach, and &ldquo;disagree violently with your Baby Boomer professors, even with no reason to.&rdquo; Also, he speaks from experience in saying &ldquo;Take over now! It&rsquo;s so easy to do that&hellip;have a big, hairy, audacious goal.&rdquo; </p>
