								<p><em>       Dr. Terry Anderson is the John and Jean DeNault Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and the executive director of the Property and Environment Research Center (PERC) in Bozeman, Montana. He has studied market-based solutions to environmental problems and is the author of Free Market Environmentalism with Donald Leal. Editor-in-Chief Benjamin Guthrie interviewed Dr. Anderson for The Stanford Review.</em></p>
								<p><strong>SR</strong>: What is free market environmentalism?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> Free market environmentalism can be summarized in two simple tenets. One is that wealthier is healthier; that is, we must have economic growth if we&rsquo;re going to have environmental quality. And economic growth comes from market systems with private property rights and a rule of law. The second tenet is that incentives matter. One way of thinking about that is, &ldquo;If it pays it stays.&rdquo; Another is, &ldquo;No one washes a rental car.&rdquo; If you put those together, you find that free market environmentalism is a way of giving people positive incentives for treating the environment better. I think that the essence of the future of environmentalism is to turn the environment from a liability, which it is under command and control, into an asset, which it is under free market environmentalism.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> Is the world running out of natural resources, and is population growth to blame?<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> This is a theme that has made the environmentalists crazy for many years. Going back to the early 1970s, Professor Ehrlich here at Stanford with his wife wrote<em> The Population Bomb</em> and predicted that exponential population growth would ultimately run up against the constraint of finite natural resources. However, when one looks at the data, there was nothing to suggest that this is happening. We are not running out of resources; rather we find new ones and we find alternative sources. Julian Simon, who often argued with Paul Ehrlich, was fond of saying that with every mouth comes two hands and a mind, and it is those two hands and a mind that have staved off natural resource scarcity and will continue to do so in the future.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> With respect to oil supplies, does drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge make sense? Would it be detrimental to biodiversity? Is it important to protect biodiversity at all costs?<br>
		    </p>
								<p><strong>TA</strong>: Oil is an example of the kind of resource that environmentalists have said we&rsquo;ll run out of. And yet what we know is that we always have more oil than we&rsquo;re consuming, and we have literally tens if not hundreds of years of supply above what we now consume. ANWR itself will make only a tiny blip in the overall oil supply so it is really not an issue in terms of world supplies or world prices. It is an issue of religion, in my opinion. This is a wilderness cathedral that environmentalists don&rsquo;t want disrupted by drilling. We can drill there without harming biodiversity. Obviously a platform displaces some animals, but it could be done in a very environmentally sensitive way so we could have our cake and eat it too. I might add that the Audubon Society does drill and produce oil and gas on its private reserves while arguing we shouldn&rsquo;t do this in a public reserve. They do it sensibly, sensitively, and profitably. </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> What are the most likely sources of alternative energy when fossil fuels are exhausted? For example, how important will ethanol for fuel in cars, hydrogen fuel cell technology, or nuclear energy be? </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> I think that this is where the market interfaces best with environmentalism. And when the market interfaces, it tells us that politicians are not very likely to predict the best alternatives. Government agencies believe they can, and hence they subsidize ethanol, subsidize hydrogen cars, and subsidize nuclear power. If the market were left to its own devices, we would be finding all kinds of alternative energy sources and alternative energy technologies if and when fossil fuels get scarce. I suspect that the hydrogen fuel cell will be part of that. I think ethanol is a giant pork barrel politics for farmers in the Midwest. And nuclear power is definitely an alternative, but the fact is that most people are not about to allow it in their backyard, especially since liability is limited by law.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> Do we need to recycle more because we are running out of landfill space?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> Recycling is perhaps the biggest environmental myth that there is. We are not running out of landfill space. You could put all of the trash generated in the United States in the next century in a tiny little parcel of land and not even find it on a map. We are not running out of landfill space except when politics disallows opening new landfills. We now have regulations that dictate that we store material in a way that is sensitive to the property rights of surrounding people. So landfill space is a political problem not a scarce land problem. The people who say &ldquo;recycle&rdquo; are simply ignoring the costs of recycling, which include the individual&rsquo;s cost of sorting garbage and the energy costs of collecting and delivering it to recycle facilities. Except for aluminum, almost no recycling makes sense. We have warehouses full of newspaper that will never be recycled. Again, like ANWR, it&rsquo;s a bit of a religion. If you want to worship at the recycling altar and feel good, that&rsquo;s your business, but it ought not to be dictated by government.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> Is the Endangered Species Act broken, and should it be fixed?<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> There is no doubt that it&rsquo;s broken, and I think the environmental community is beginning to see that. The Endangered Species Act penalizes people who have habitat for species. Some research done by a colleague of mine in Montana shows that people cut their trees in order to avoid having Red Cocaded Woodpeckers inhabit them because if the woodpeckers come in, the regulators follow, and they regulate your land use. So we need to find ways of rewarding people who provide habitat. That could be done through private organizations that are willing to purchase or lease habitat. And that&rsquo;s what groups such as the Nature Conservancy do in some cases. Or it could be done through government, where the government, rather than taking habitat or taking land from people who have habitat, actually rewards them for providing that. If it&rsquo;s a public good, then let the public pay the landowner who produces it.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> What role does government have in protecting the environment? What types of policies would you recommend<br>
								  to achieve this goal?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> Many people would say that libertarians have no role for government, but in fact somehow we have to have property rights defined and enforced and a rule of law to make that happen. The role of government in the environmental area is much the same &ndash; to hold people accountable for their effluent that crosses the boundaries of other people be it their lungs or their private real estate. And that ought to be the main function of government &ndash; to define and enforce property rights in a way that people can defend themselves against pollution and to reward people who are good stewards of natural resources and the environment. Beyond that, there are cases where it is difficult to have a market system with private property rights, such as the ocean fisheries and airsheds. In those cases, the government can actually create property rights. We can have fishing quotas being established and handed out to fisherman who can then trade them. This gives them a stake in the fishery. We do the same with air pollution, giving people a stake in finding more cost effective ways of cleaning up the air.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> What are some solutions to the problem of air pollution? Do you think carpool lanes on the freeway serve to make the air cleaner?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> Air pollution is a tough problem for people who are looking for market solutions. With respect to the freeways, the problem is that we don&rsquo;t price the freeways. While HOV lanes help to allocate the traffic and keep it moving in one lane, they are not nearly as effective as pricing schemes that have been used even here in California. Air pollution generally is best handled first through some common law system where people are held accountable for the pollution that they create. When that is difficult to do, then cap and trade programs work. That is, we can cap the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted into the air and then allow people to trade credits for reduced sulfur emissions. That program was written into the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and has been an effective way of reducing sulfur emissions at a far lower cost than the typical command and control regulations.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR</strong>: Are globalization and free trade harmful to the environment because multinational corporations can get away with polluting the air or water of developing countries?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> Globalization has become a buzz word that environmentalists have grabbed onto as a way to really stop trade and economic growth. I don&rsquo;t think that globalization has in any significant way altered the world&rsquo;s environment unless it is to improve it. First off, I think we need to understand that as countries&rsquo; grow their environments improve. And globalization and free trade help countries grow. So we&rsquo;ll get more environmental quality if we have economic growth. Second, I think it&rsquo;s important to note that, even in the developing world where there are private property systems and rules of law, the environment is cleaner, land is better cared for, and so on.</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>SR:</strong> Is there an inevitable trade off between helping people and protecting the environment?</p>
								<p><br>
								  <strong>TA:</strong> By no means is there a trade off. In fact it goes the other way. Economic growth not only helps people by giving them longer lives, more clothing, more food, and more health care; it also gives them a cleaner environment. Every study I have seen suggests that there is a positive correlation between economic growth and environmental quality. So it&rsquo;s crucial that we have the institutions of markets, property rights, and rule of law to promote economic growth and at the same time promote improved environmental quality. </p>
								<p><strong>SR: </strong>Is global warming a problem? If so, is the Kyoto Protocol the solution?<br>
		    </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> Global warming is the mother of all environmental issues and the trump card for all environmentalists. If you can convince environmentalists that we can solve endangered species issues or land use issues or recycling issues with markets, they always have global warming as the issue to fall back upon. I think that the data are convincing that the globe is warming. It is still questionable in my mind as to whether that is caused by human beings, though recent studies suggest that it is. Even if you accept that it is, Kyoto is definitely not the answer. If all countries in the world did everything that Kyoto prescribed, and that means India and China complying, we would only stave off global temperature increases for about four years over the next century. In other words, we&rsquo;d achieve the same temperature level, but we&rsquo;d achieve it four years later. And it would come at a huge cost. If global warming is a problem, the best solution for it is for economies to have economic growth that allows them to take care of the carbon problems. And once again, we see that countries like the United States are beginning to emit less carbon and to sequester more carbon because of market forces.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> Would you say that being a socialist is a prerequisite for being a good environmentalist? Could you recommend some alternative environmental organizations to the Sierra Club or GreenPeace for liberty-minded individuals?<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> Socialism is certainly not a prerequisite for being a good environmentalist, but most environmentalists have chosen to follow a socialist path &ndash; that is a command and control path. I think that the command and control path has not proven to be very effective &ndash; that we have not gotten the results that we might want if we care about the environment. So one can be an environmentalist, one can be a conservative, one can be a classical liberal and still find solutions that are far better than command and control. I think that the market approach is an approach that gives people who are environmentalists, such as myself, a way to combat the standard socialism of command and control. Perhaps the best of the big groups in this regard is Environmental Defense, formerly the Environmental Defense Fund. It at one time had an unwritten slogan of &ldquo;sue the bastards,&rdquo; and today has the slogan of &ldquo;finding ways that work.&rdquo; And many of those ways include markets. My institute PERC [Property and Environment Research Center] in Bozeman, Montana is an organization that promotes market approaches to environmental problems and provides an alternative for how we can solve the kinds of problems that we all care about.<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>SR:</strong> Could you recommend a few books for someone interested in environmentalism, including at least one of your own?<br>
								  </p>
								<p><strong>TA:</strong> Well, I&rsquo;m always a little reluctant to recommend my own books, but my book with Donald Leal, <em>Free Market Environmentalism</em>, is seen by many as the best source of a complete description of how markets can solve environmental problems. A follow-on to that is another book that we wrote entitled <em>Enviro-Capitalists: Doing Good While Doing Well</em>. It is much more a case study book than a treatise on how you can apply markets. My colleague Richard Stroup has a book <em>Eco-nomics</em>, which is an excellent read for someone who really wants to understand the economics. I recently edited a book for the Hoover Institution entitled<em> You Have to Admit It&rsquo;s Getting Better: From Economic Prosperity to Environmental Quality</em>. And finally I&rsquo;d highly recommend Bjorn Lomborg&rsquo;s book <em>The Skeptical Environmentalist</em>. In that book Bjorn Lomborg, a professed leftist from Denmark, makes the case strongly that the environmental litany as he describes it simply does not hold up under the data. We aren&rsquo;t running out of resources. We aren&rsquo;t destroying our water. We aren&rsquo;t destroying our air. We aren&rsquo;t experiencing global deforestation. It&rsquo;s a must read for anyone who considers himself to be an environmentalist.</p>
