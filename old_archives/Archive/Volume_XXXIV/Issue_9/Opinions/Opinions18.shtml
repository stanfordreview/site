								<p>Ah... the American dream.  A land where all are created equal.  A land where no citizen is to be denied equal protection of the laws.  Of course, such an idealistic vision of America may be a bit na&iuml;ve.  Indeed, America has seen the legalization of slavery, women&rsquo;s suffrage, desegregation and a host of other social movements whose outcome ought to be self-evident given America&rsquo;s founding vision, yet took years to reconcile.  Luckily for members of my generation, the &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; signs of the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s have now become socially impermissible and obsolete.  Yet, where some have pushed for equality, others have demanded special privilege.  The &ldquo;whites only&rdquo; signs of Eisenhower&rsquo;s era have been replaced by the &ldquo;under represented minorities only&rdquo; signs of Bush&rsquo;s era.  Yet, no politician is willing to stand up and call the system for what it is - racist.  <br>
								</p>
								<p>Why?  Our day and age is characterized by a government that functions not &ldquo;by the people and for the people,&rdquo; but by catering to special interest groups.  A political party that cannot pull enough special interest factions on board will inevitably lose elections.  Few interest groups are more important to the Democrat&rsquo;s political outlook than the tried and true voting block headed by the NAACP.  Thus, it was with much hullabaloo that in the recent Democratic primaries, Denis Kucinich, Dick Gephardt, and Joe Lieberman were all forced to stand on stage like a bunch of crybabies and beg the NAACP for its endorsement.  The picture wasn&rsquo;t much prettier for John Kerry, who in an attempt to cover his stiff image, also gave the standard &ldquo;power to the people&rdquo; &ldquo;rags to riches&rdquo; pitch to NAACP members.  The bottom line: Democrats need solid voter turnout among blacks in order to win elections, which they get by favoring programs that benefit the &ldquo;black community.&rdquo;  Thus, any criticism of race-based hiring practices from Democrats would likely cost the party votes.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Yet, Republicans are not immune to special interest politics.  In fact, if the recent election is to be any indicator of the Republican&rsquo;s aspirations to court new voters, a major demographic shift may be in the works.  True, some of the Republican Party&rsquo;s most dedicated support has always come from Latinos, particularly those who have escaped the wretched communist hellholes that exist in Latin America.  However, the support has also always been relatively isolated within the Latino demographic as a whole.  By pushing a socially conservative stance on issues such as partial birth abortion, the Republican Party has been able to make large inroads among Latino voters.  Indeed, it appears that the Republican Party seeks to build a majority of support among Latinos in the future.  Consequently, no matter which party you choose, the line will be the same: &ldquo;our party can promise your interest groups more handouts.&rdquo;  <br>
								</p>
								<p>I continually receive offers for internships that do not only consider race among many factors, but consider it as THE factor.  Two such offers appeared in my inbox this week.  First, Management Leadership for Tomorrow offers an excellent program to help students gain exposure, expert advice, personalized instruction, skills development and a number of job opportunities in the business world... so long as you&rsquo;re Black, Latino or Native American.  As their website explains, &ldquo;our research identified Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans as under-represented groups at leading business school programs and the fast-track entry-level jobs that feed into them. Therefore, our program is only open to members of these groups.&rdquo;  Their argument is plain and simple: &ldquo;there is not enough pigment in American business schools; therefore we are justified in using race preferences.&rdquo;  Funny, since males are now &ldquo;underrepresented&rdquo; in many professional schools, I don&rsquo;t see a huge push for &ldquo;males only&rdquo; development programs to boost attendance.  Even if it is the case that more individuals fit a certain arbitrary description than others, is that a sufficient justification?  Those who continually push for numerical measures of &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; &ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; or whoever else are merely fortifying the walls of racism.  Is an individual from Cuba akin to an individual from Mexico?  Is someone from Nigeria really the same as someone from Egypt?  Of course not.  Yet the statistics so proudly touted by American universities would sure make you think so.  It is as if there is some neat, cookie cutter category that everyone from a particular continent fits into.  <br>
								</p>
								<p>Thus, I decided to investigate further.  How Latino does one have to be in order to be counted as &ldquo;Latino?&rdquo;  Well, I decided to find out.  I sent an email to one of the coordinators of the Career Planning &amp; Job Placement Program, one of Management Leadership for Tomorrow&rsquo;s three programs.  The coordinator was kind enough to respond, informing me that 1&#x2044;2 Latino does, indeed, qualify as Latino.  So where does the cutoff lie?  Where is the line drawn that distinguished me as a &ldquo;Caucasian&rdquo; in our university&rsquo;s prized statistics?  Unfortunately, my second email was not returned.<br>
								</p>
								<p> Disappointed and curious, I turned to the Fremont Bank, which is looking for a Latino to work in their mortgage department this summer through &ldquo;Project Latino&rsquo;s on Fast Track.&rdquo;  Yep, a program that helps put &ldquo;Latino&rsquo;s&rdquo; on the fast track to success.  Whites need not apply.  Since I probably have some sort of Latino heritage, I also sent them a quick email to see if I might quality.  Apparently, by their standards, if you&rsquo;re half-Latino, you meet the bar.  What about 1/64th Latino?  Astonishingly, after inquiring further, I was notified that 1/64th Latino also qualifies.  ONE-SIXTY FOURTH.  That&rsquo;s... SIX generations.  Apparently if my great-great-great-great-grandmother was 100% Latino, I would also meet the bar.  Well, what about those of us that only have a great-great-great-great-great-grandmother who is Latino?  Well, unfortunately those individuals are out in the cold when it comes to race politics as my subsequent emails were again not returned.<br>
								</p>
								<p>The question that this all boils down to is &ldquo;what are the benefits and costs of these programs?&rdquo;  The benefits are clear: in the short term there will be more &ldquo;color&rdquo; in business schools.  Yet, the costs remain unclear.  When I asked Carol Mosley Braun that question last year she told me that those on the losing end of race politics would simply find fulfillment elsewhere.  In other words, it does not matter if separate standards are applied on the basis of race, so long as the product is &ldquo;equal.&rdquo;  Yet, how do we define equal?  Even then, is denying someone the opportunity for a job on the basis of race acceptable, merely because they will find a similar job elsewhere?  That justification sounds strikingly like the one presented in Plessy vs. Ferguson back in 1896!  &ldquo;Separate but equal,&rdquo; they argued, was not a violation of the fourteenth amendment.  I submit that programs such as Project LOFT merely target a symptom, just as separate facilities allowed America to avoid the reality of racism in 1896.  While artificially boosting minority representation, race preferences reinforce the underlying barriers that create racism in the first place.  In this day and age, the supposed racial divides are blurred to a greater extent than ever before.  The possibility for equality has never been greater.  Yet, race distinctions only further the notion that unequal treatment on the basis of race is acceptable.  I have no problem with extending opportunity, but does a program that only benefits &ldquo;Latinos&rdquo; really do that?  The bottom line is that, as Bill Clinton remarked, it is high time that we actually &ldquo;mend it.&rdquo;  All I see is race politics.  Do we want to live in 1896 or do we want to move forward?<br>
