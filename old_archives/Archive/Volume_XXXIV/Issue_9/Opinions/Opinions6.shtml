								</p>
								<p>I stood there on that chilly night and held my hand against that cold, cold wall. It wasn&rsquo;t your usual cold that night. It was the sort of freezing chill that penetrated deep down into your spine and made your whole body so numb you couldn&rsquo;t even shiver to keep yourself warm. Maybe the flood of sensation had to do with the fact that this was no ordinary night, nor any ordinary wall. For almost 2000 years, Jews from all around the world have made pilgrimage to this same spot, the kotel ha&rsquo;ma&rsquo;ariv, the western wall, the last remaining remnant of what was once the center of the entire Jewish universe. <br>
								</p>
								<p>Its destruction was such a shock to the Jewish psyche that the anniversary of its destruction became a day of mourning; a supplication to G-d calling for its return was added to the daily prayer and it was decreed that great works should be left slightly unfinished to remind us of the imperfect, temple-less world we now dwelled in. Over the centuries, what came to be known as the Wailing Wall became the last physical landmark connecting what became Rabbinic Judaism with its origins. For millennia, Jews had risked their lives to do what I was now doing, standing their trying to feel something both beyond that wall and perhaps deep within myself that could for a moment grant me some sort of contact with the divine. <br>
								</p>
								<p>My concentration was dampened by the fact that standing probably less than 200 yards away from me was a large number of people who would no doubt love nothing better than to erase me not just from where I was standing, but from the face of the earth. The metal detectors and heavily armed security made that point abundantly clear: above that wall was enemy territory. Our holiest site was right in the middle of a war zone.  Sadly, as far as Jewish holy sites go, this was less the exception and more the rule. <br>
								</p>
								<p>A couple of months ago a friend of mine tried to take a trip to the second most holy site in Judaism, the Cave of the Patriarchs, in Hebron. For years, Jews who have tried to visit these sites (perhaps somewhat analogous to the Church of the Nativity for Christians) have had to do so at great personal risk, traveling only in armored buses with bulletproof windows and armed escort. This is perhaps a microcosm for the entire country, which would literally be pushed into the sea tomorrow if it were to let its guard down. The tragic reality of almost six decades of hot and cold conflict have created a mindset of hyper-vigilance and fatalism that is unlike anything else Jews have  experienced.<br>
								</p>
								<p>It is a state of mind that is hard to understand without actually seeing it: in Israel, they check your bags going into a store, not going out. Every third person walking around is carrying some sort of firearm. You can&rsquo;t leave your purse or backpack at your seat in a public place unattended for longer than five minutes without it being imploded. In the history of the Diaspora, Jews were never known as an aggressive people. This reality is not the consequence of Israeli aggression and &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;, it is the reaction to fighting an enemy which has reduced its tactics to the least common denominator. In a world where the person sitting next to you in a cafe or on a bus could detonate a hidden bomb on them at any time, its forgivable to be a little paranoid.<br>
								</p>
								<p>The reality on the other side of the wall at which I stood was a very dire one. Palestinian television stations transmitting children&rsquo;s programming that glorifies violence and portrays suicide bombers out as heroes; radical Imams who decree that it is the duty of every Muslim to engage in armed struggle against the fascist state and the desecration of both Jewish and Christian holy sites. The forces the Israelis have been pitted against by history have created a culture that glorifies suicide and murder. The Palestinians, with the encouragement of the Arab world, have created a society whose modus vivendi is the annihilation of its neighboring state through use of the most horrible tactics imaginable. A clear moral distinction therefore exists between an Israeli soldier manning a checkpoint and a suicide bomber: the Israeli soldier kills as a final alternative to protect himself and his countrymen; the suicide bomber in his mind has committed his entire being exclusively to this purpose.  The worship of death to which these young souls have committed themselves can be called nothing short of evil by a rational human being. <br>
								</p>
								<p>We judge our enemies by the tactics they use. In the previous century, the western powers engaged in nothing short of Total War, as Clausewitz would put it, to annihilate regimes of similar moral character. Nazi Germany was a sick society, but never in Hitler&rsquo;s wildest dreams did he envision an army of soldiers willing to serve as human cruise missiles. A society that is willing to sacrifice its children deliberately in order to harm its enemy is of a moral lower plane than even the Nazis, who did not lower the draft age to 14 until they were practically reduced to the last man and even then were not of the habit of attaching explosive belts to them and forcing them to charge the enemy and detonate themselves. The reluctance of the Arab world and the Palestinian authority to actively condemn and crack down on the practice of suicide bombing is the product of either them actively condoning the practice or being powerless to stop those who do. <br>
								</p>
								<p>The western world has been hesitant to side with the Israelis and put the Palestinians and the Arab world at large on notice that these tactics will only result in a more measured (and effective due to the superiority of western firepower) response. This is long overdue; on the eve of a prospective pullout and Israel offering an olive branch, it is time for the world community to get behind the Israelis and make the point that this is the Palestinians last chance to get it right. No more suicide bombings, no more protracted resistance, or the tactics of total war will have to be implemented. Without this sort of an ultimatum it is unlikely that any lasting peace will be successful. <br>
								</p>
								<p>As I stood at the wall with hundreds of other Jews from all around the world, I looked up at the armed Israeli guards who watched over us and protected us. It was breathtakingly clear that if the Arabs put down their guns tomorrow, there would be no conflict. If the Israelis put down their guns tomorrow, there would be no Israel.<br>
