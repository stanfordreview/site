								</p>
								<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked to say something about political bias here, particularly as I, as a generally conservative law student, see and experience it. Of course, we all have our own biases as to what constitutes bias, and before I say &ldquo;There&rsquo;s none here&rdquo; I should disclose my own.<br>
								</p>
								<p>I graduated from Brown five years ago. I did public policy work in Washington, D.C., where I&rsquo;m from, for two years later. Then I moved to London to study for a year. Now I&rsquo;m here, and it&rsquo;s not even close. This campus is as apolitical a place as I&rsquo;ve ever been. Why? Sometimes I think it&rsquo;s just because it&rsquo;s too nice outside to argue about things. I&rsquo;d rather go mountain biking.<br>
								</p>
								<p>I don&rsquo;t, I should be clear, say this with any despair whatsoever. I love Stanford, and I love Stanford students for thinking they have better things to do with their time than fight with one another about what&rsquo;s going on in Gaza. Some people might think it&rsquo;s a shame. And those people are wrong.<br>
								</p>
								<p>So what about the Law School? What&rsquo;s it like? Well, this one Asian kid keeps whining because we don&rsquo;t have any Asian professors. My impression is most people wish he would just shut up. There&rsquo;s also a good deal of back-and-forth about what people should and should not send to law-announce, our listserve. Oh, and our Dean of Students asked us&#151;no, told us&#151;not to drink in Kresge. There was a bit of a fuss&#151;and a lot of drinking regardless. In Criminal Law last year, there was some mild disagreement when we covered rape about what ought to constitute consent. But believe it or not, most people think sex is almost always a good thing and are fine with our law presuming as much. There is not much outrage at the Law School when I suggest to people that we should legalize prostitution as a means of combating rape. We&rsquo;re big fans of efficient exchange over here.<br>
								</p>
								<p>What about our faculty? I bet most of them voted for John Kerry. But isn&rsquo;t this basically meaningless? I mean, they&rsquo;re California residents, and in a line of work our market doesn&rsquo;t reward as much as perhaps it ought to. Sure, our Tax all-star doesn&rsquo;t think taxation is theft, nor does he believe in creative evasion. Our Constitutional Lawyers probably all believe in a constitutional right to sodomy and abortion, but not in one to discriminate. Our Crime guys&#151;and they are all guys&#151;don&rsquo;t strike me as huge fans of punishment. But none of this amounts to oppressive or even apparent bias. Besides, we&rsquo;ve got a libertarian. We&rsquo;ve got a few Law and Economics folks who are willing to price just about anything. We&rsquo;ve got Larry Lessig himself, who is predictable only insofar as he always wears a pair of black jeans to class and doesn&rsquo;t miss a chance to let you know you&rsquo;re inferior. One professor who teaches Evidence is a former prosecutor. Another was a public defender. I&rsquo;m sure one of our Corporate Law guys&#151;and they&rsquo;re all guys, too&#151;goes to Starbucks every morning for his coffee. There&rsquo;s even one professor whom I&rsquo;m convinced is a Hegelian, and deep down believes in pain.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. The Stanford Law School is an amazing place. Our professors are first-rate teachers and first-rate scholars. Almost everyone I know is passionate about their fields of interest. We&rsquo;re just not agitators. We all have political preferences, to be sure, but few of us have political identities. It&rsquo;s not anyone&rsquo;s purpose to be a conservative, or be a liberal. We want to study hard, do well in our classes, write, think about our careers, and if there&rsquo;s time leftover, get drunk together. Politics is an afterthought. Sure, some students are interested in &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; careers, but not because they see themselves zealously fighting for a better world. They&rsquo;re just interested in, say, children&rsquo;s rights, or defending criminals. &ldquo;Public interest&rdquo; suggests nothing of content these days anyway. (Prosecutors are &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; lawyers too, you know.) All we can say with certainty about this work is it pays abominably.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s a Federalist Society chapter here, and an American Constitution Society chapter. Federalists are faithful Bushies, more or less. ACS&rsquo;ers are mostly children. They like to make fun of one another, and people who are members of neither typically like to make fun of them. They sponsor speakers and other events, sometimes collaboratively. Generally they&rsquo;re well-attended, if only because lunch or dinner is served. Different views are offered and heard. The Federalists are great marketers; they hook us up with Taco Bell and In and Out. <br>
								</p>
								<p>To some extent I think this is all a sign of intellectual maturity. Our biggest public debates are, in my view, hopelessly intractable; they reduce to foundational, intuitional views about what&rsquo;s fair, right, good, just, and valuable. What point is there in arguing? It was a fabulous moment last year when my Torts professor said as much in class. I&rsquo;m hazy on what we were talking about&#151;maybe social host liability for partiers who get drunk, drive home, and kill someone&#151;but he stopped taking comments and said, &ldquo;Guys, isn&rsquo;t it just an op-ed from here?&rdquo; Translation: &ldquo;Would you guys please just shut up?&rdquo;<br>
								</p>
								<p>In my book, conservatives who obsess about liberal biases in academia and dig for ammunition are up there with people who dress up like Star Wars characters and wait in ticket lines for days. Really, guys, come on. Take Comet the Insult Dog&rsquo;s advice, and go have sex. Once upon a time Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza wrote this great little book called Illiberal Education. It was a dumbed-down version of a much more serious book by Allan Bloom called The Closing of the American Mind. There was such a thing as political correctness. It stifled thought. It demeaned people who weren&rsquo;t Marxists. It made American universities look like absurd places. It was nihilistic and relativistic. I&rsquo;m just not sure it&rsquo;s such a big problem anymore. There&rsquo;ll always be graduate students in English or History who think socialism is a good idea. Big surprise there; they want praise from a society to which they contribute nothing. Next time Al Queda hits us, some putz will call it &ldquo;poetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;Social construction&rdquo; will always be a more preferable explanation for things than &ldquo;nature.&rdquo;<br>
								</p>
								<p>But look around. Ask someone with a John Kerry bumper sticker on her Nalgene bottle what she&rsquo;s doing later, and chances are it won&rsquo;t involve a sit-in or a candlelight vigil. Ask your professors what they&rsquo;re working on, and chances are it won&rsquo;t seem political. When you think a class comes with an agenda, don&rsquo;t gripe about bias. Laugh at its idiocy. Stand by your own brilliance. And then give it up. Chances are it&rsquo;ll be a beautiful day outside.<br>
