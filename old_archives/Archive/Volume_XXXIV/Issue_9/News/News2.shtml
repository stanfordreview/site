								<p>On May 9th, the Honorable Jim Sensenbrenner, a Congressman representing the Fifth Congressional District of Wisconsin, spoke to a small audience about his experiences in the ongoing fight between the legislature and judiciary. <br>
								</p>
								<p>Jim Sensenbrenner is a seasoned politician with an impressive career. A Stanford alumni having majored in Political Science (Class of &rsquo;65), Mr. Sensenbrenner continued on to receive a law degree from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1968. He then served in the Wisconsin State Legislature for ten years, first as a State Representative and then as a State Senator. During most of his years as a State Senator, Sensenbrenner acted as the assistant Republican minority leader. <br>
								</p>
								<p>Since being elected as a Republican member of the 96th Congress in November of 1978, Sensenbrenner has been an active member of the House. He has been directly involved in the impeachment proceedings of both US District Court Judge Walter L. Nixon in 1989 and President Bill Clinton in 1998. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, Sensenbrenner served as the chairman of the House Committee on Science. He was then appointed his current chairmanship on the House Committee on the Judiciary in the 107th Congress. Sensenbrenner also participates as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security. <br>
								</p>
								<p>He began his talk by defining the relationship between the legislative and judiciary branches of government, establishing that the judiciary branch of government has control over all federal courts and some inferior courts to interpret the law. But all judicial powers, as Sensenbrenner pointed out, are justified by an &ldquo;act of Congress,&rdquo; referring to the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established America&rsquo;s judicial system. Hence, Congress has the right to legislate changes to the judiciary branch, including changes to its budget.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Sensenbrenner suggested an office of the inspector general for the federal judiciary to promote &ldquo;good government.&rdquo; The office of the inspector general &ldquo;would not violate the separation of powers doctrine,&rdquo; though he anticipated a power struggle between Congress and the courts. The judiciary branch must be investigated to be &ldquo;judicious with its resources&rdquo; or the American people should have a right to change something to put its tax dollars to better use, said Sensenbrenner. In addition, the inspector general would be able to monitor judges for impeachable misconduct, though Sensenbrenner strongly cautioned against violating the life tenure provided to judges by the Constitution. He did recognize that while it is important to promote good government, Congress cannot be allowed to &ldquo;neuter the courts.&rdquo; Sensenbrenner quoted political writer Charles Krauthammer in three principles that would be ideal for the justice system: &ldquo;Immediacy, finality, legitimacy.&rdquo;  Legitimacy, said Sensenbrenner, can only be achieved by protecting and insulating judges from removal or impeachment from unpopular decisions. Nonetheless, the inspector general would be able to manage how we punish and who does the punishing for judges&rsquo; misconduct.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Sensenbrenner also discussed a proposal to split the 9th Circuit of the US Court of Appeals into three separate Circuits. This has been a topic in the legislative branch that has apparently been &ldquo;kicked around for at least 30 years.&rdquo; The 9th Circuit covers cases in all of California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, and Montana. However, the &ldquo;immense size negatively affects court decisions.&rdquo; According to Sensenbrenner, there is a significant lack of &ldquo;coordination and consistency&rdquo; in rulings, including &ldquo;too many contradictory panels in the same week.&rdquo; He referred back to the separation of the 5th Circuit (now 5th and 11th Circuits), and pointed out that the split has helped case management as well as varying the types of cases brought to each circuit. Congressman Sensenbrenner hopes to be able to pass legislation splitting the 9th Circuit soon.<br>
								</p>
								<p>The topic that elicited most questions from the audience was legislation restricting citation of foreign sources in domestic rulings. Sensenbrenner emphasized that the &ldquo;ruling of a court in Zimbabwe or France is irrelevant&rdquo; to an American ruling. Americans have never &ldquo;consented to foreign jurisdiction,&rdquo; he said. American rulings have always &ldquo;relied on the Constitution, not on foreign documents.&rdquo; Sensenbrenner pointed to the &ldquo;worst violation&rdquo; in citing foreign sources, Roeper vs. Simmons, where the US Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that it was unconstitutional to execute offenders that had committed their crimes under the age of 18, affecting 72 offenders across the nation. The Supreme Court cited foreign sources, including the UN convention on the rights of a child (never ratified by the US Congress), as basis for its ruling. Sensenbrenner worried that citing foreign sources is becoming &ldquo;less and less supplementary and more integral&rdquo; in court decisions. He reaffirmed that any legislation relating to foreign citations would reassert the primacy of the American Constitution.<br>
								</p>
								<p>Despite his criticisms of the judiciary, Sensenbrenner constantly repeated that he strongly believed that &ldquo;the system works&rdquo; as long as the American people promote good government. When asked about the judicial branch&rsquo;s significant role in upholding human rights and the dangers of allowing a popularly-elected Congress to legislate on the judiciary&rsquo;s foothold in justice, Sensenbrenner replied that anything &ldquo;Constitution-guaranteed&rdquo; should never be put to popular vote. However, &ldquo;legislation would give finality to many debates&rdquo; including abortion and civil rights. He said that he simply did not like to see legislature left out of the loop, but he would never promote violation of separation of powers.</p>
