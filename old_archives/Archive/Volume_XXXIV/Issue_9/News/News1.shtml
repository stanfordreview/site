								<p>Imagine, just for a moment, that you are a young and impressionable freshman. You are a proud American, of course (aren&rsquo;t we all?), and believe strongly in free markets and capitalism, the foundations of 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											America 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									&rsquo;s&nbsp; contract with liberty. You are idealistic, and convinced that in this stockpot of intellectual freedom and enlightenment you will find an efficiently-run, well-oiled, administrative machine.</p>
								<p>Then you look into a slightly more literal stockpot and find... split pea soup (that will be $4.75 for a bowl, please).</p>
								<p>Which is fine, of course, except that you don&rsquo;t really like split pea soup. And you certainly don&rsquo;t like split pea soup that costs $4656 per annum.</p>
								<p>The mystery that is Stanford Dining should thus be explained.</p>
								<p>First, the standard definition: Stanford Dining is the division of Residential &amp; Dining Enterprises that operates most of the eateries on campus, and almost all of the restaurants open to the general public. While Stanford Dining&rsquo;s unnecessary self-propagandizing and endearing mix tapes may be most conspicuous at its residential dining locations (essentially everywhere except the Row, Suites, and Toyon), the service also has a hand in the CoHo, Olives, and its conveniently-located and student-focused &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; restaurant LINX at the Clark Center.</p>
								<p>Of course, Stanford Dining is also mandatory. That is to say, unless you happen to live in one of the few residential locations that is not affiliated with Dining Services, you are obligated to sign on for a meal plan. In the 2004-2005 school year, meal plans cost between $4081 and $4578. Next year, all meal plans will cost the same: $4656. For many students, this will mean a cost increase of almost $600.</p>
								<p>Many students fear that this cost increase will eventually belie a campus-wide decrease in the quality of food and service. Most point to another dining reform: in order to make the dining situation more flexible and less confusing, all dining halls on campus will shift to &ldquo;all-you-care-to-eat&rdquo; service, meaning that the &ldquo;shove-it-all-on-the-tray&rdquo; mentality of Stern and FloMo will be extended to the more modestly wasteful centers at Wilbur and Manzanita, which currently provide &ldquo;a la carte&rdquo; dining.</p>
								<p>This, despite the general consensus that the best options for residential dining are Wilbur and Manzanita. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely better at Wilbur than Stern,&rdquo; says freshman James Gao. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re forced to cook better quality meals because it&rsquo;s a la carte.&rdquo; Freshman Chase Grayson admits, &ldquo;Whenever I go to Stern, I just waste a lot of food.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
								<p>The colossal food waste that can already be observed after each meal will only be exacerbated with a complete reliance on all-you-care-to-eat service, many fear. We often forget that all-you-care-to-eat is the politically correct adaptation of &ldquo;all-you-can-eat,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s fairly clear that many students take that all-you-can offer to the extreme, choosing some of everything in the hopes that at least something will be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;There is obviously more waste at all-you-care-to-eat dining halls, so they are worse for the environment,&rdquo; notes freshman Sarah Rizk, Environment Representative for Junipero. Still, Rizk is optimistic that students will use Cardinal Dollars to cut down on waste. Under the new reforms, students will have the option of purchasing 19 meals per week with no Cardinal Dollars, 14 meals per week plus 420 Cardinal Dollars, or 10 meals per week plus 750 Cardinal Dollars. Cardinal Dollars can be used at many retail dining locations across campus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Stanford Dining is, by most accounts, decently well-regarded in the college dining community. College Prowler (&ldquo;200 Guides for 200 Top Colleges&rdquo;) awards Stanford a B grade, which is unsurprisingly&nbsp; average. Dozens of colleges are ranked lower; dozens more are ranked higher.</p>
								<p>There is, somewhat surprisingly however, no clear correlation between the quality of college dining and the cost that students can pay (or are forced to pay) at their respective colleges. At 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
											Cornell 
										</st1:PlaceName>
										<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
											University 
										</st1:PlaceType>
									</st1:place>
									, considered to harbor one of the best college dining services in the nation, students will pay just $4170 under the &ldquo;Bear Traditional&rdquo; plan to enjoy 14 meals per week at any dining hall on campus, as well as 1000 &ldquo;Big Red Bucks&rdquo; &#150; Cornell&rsquo;s version of Cardinal Dollars. In case you&rsquo;re counting, that adds up to almost $600 more dollars worth of award-winning dining for almost $500 less than at Stanford. Cornell also offers the Bear Choice and Bear Basic plans, whereby light or infrequent eaters can pay just $1700 per semester. Best yet, meal plans at Cornell are completely optional.</p>
								<p>&ldquo;The Cornell system does have really great food, especially at the a la carte places because each one has specialty kinds of food,&rdquo; raves Cornell freshman Nina Coutinho. &ldquo;We have this joke that says that they feed us well because that&rsquo;s the only way to keep us on this god-forsaken campus.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Elsewhere, meal plans are even cheaper. At highly-ranked 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
											Boston 
										</st1:PlaceName>
										<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
											University 
										</st1:PlaceType>
									</st1:place>
									, a 14-meal per week plan (plus $400 in dining points) costs just $3630. At the well-regarded dining halls of 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
											Dartmouth 
										</st1:PlaceName>
										<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
											College 
										</st1:PlaceType>
									</st1:place>
									, the standard meal plan costs just $4100. In fact, meal plans cost more at Stanford than they do at almost any other college in the 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											United States 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Dining administrators at Cornell and other colleges that allow students to elect to purchase a meal plan, clearly assume that the quality of food will speak for itself. Students will be attracted by the convenience of the dining halls on campus, but will ultimately purchase the food because they know that, in general, they will want to eat it. No coercion required, no meal plan &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; in order to ensure that the Stanford Dining coffers are bursting at the seams. Just basic consumer preferences being exercised.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>Which brings us to what may be the most revealing definition: Stanford Dining is, above all, a monopoly. A monopoly, legally, is &ldquo;the abuse of free commerce by which one or more individuals have procured the advantage of selling alone all of a particular kind of merchandise, to the detriment of the public.&rdquo; At Stanford, this particular merchandise is food; by the definition, we the public feel the detrimental effects of being forced to buy into this food monopoly.</p>
								<p>At Stanford the independent restaurants and fast food chains that proliferate at other university campuses are almost eerily nonexistent. This is not, we can confidently surmise, due to a bizarre statistical aversion among Stanford students to Jack-in-the-Box or Panda Express. Instead, these chains face barriers to entry that prevent them from opening up a Stanford Dining alternative.</p>
								<p>At Cornell, students have the options of purchasing &ldquo;City Bucks,&rdquo; which can be used at on-campus independent locations and also at numerous restaurants in beautiful 
									<st1:City w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											Ithaca 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:City>
									. Such a program as been adopted at many schools that want their students to have more choice, and local proprietors are more than happy to oblige. Cardinal Dollars are about as useful off-campus as Monopoly money, and independent on-campus dining alternatives are few and far between.</p>
								<p>But really, such alternatives would not be cost-effective anyways. Since at Stanford meal plans are required, any &ldquo;dinners out&rdquo; mean forfeiting meals that have already been paid for.&nbsp;</p>
								<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tyrannical,&rdquo; says freshman Matt Stoltz. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to force people to pay for more food than they want to eat. I&rsquo;m probably going to have a couple hundred points left over this quarter.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>A couple hundred meal points, or 42 bowls of split pea soup.</p>
