								<p>In my pursuit of a topic to write on this week, I again turned to a trusty friend: my email inbox. Indeed, my inbox has often been a magnet for inflammatory political emails. Those that know me well also know that I enjoy a good email debate every now and then. As it turns out, this week was no exception. Sure enough, just when I thought I might have hit a writer&rsquo;s block, there was an email from my trusty friend Dan, an economics guru that shares my passion for debate. Dan sent me the link to an article in the LA Times entitled &ldquo;A Very Special Kind of Math.&rdquo; In the article, author Jonathan Chait claims that the argument for tax cuts is founded on a logical fallacy; conservatives misinterpret data indicating that the wealthy pay a larger and larger portion of our nation&rsquo;s taxes as evidence that the tax burden has become more progressive, when in reality it is merely a product of greater wealth inequality. Not only do I believe Chait&rsquo;s conclusion to be incorrect, I believe his editorial represents a complete misunderstanding of the economic principles behind a tax cut. Thus, since my first article on tax cuts apparently was unsuccessful, I thought I might again devote my column to debunking a couple of myths about Bush&rsquo;s tax cut.</p>
								<p>Liberals often understand the &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; perspective on tax cuts as the belief that by benefiting the wealthy, money will &ldquo;trickle down&rdquo; to workers. Though this belief has even been echoed by some conservatives, it is a gross oversimplification of the way a tax cut actually works. Take Bush&rsquo;s support for a reduction in capital gains taxes. Liberals claim that such a policy would merely be a handout to wealthy business owners, stealing money from the government that might be better spent on more entitlement programs. Yet, that is not the way economics works.</p>
								<p>Our economy is not a static entity with a fixed amount of output. It is a dynamic machine, constantly churning out new innovations and products. Yet, these products do not come about without risk. Any new business expenditure is a risk to the company, and the company hedges its bets that the investment will pay off in the long term. Among other things, a reduction in capital gains taxes incentivizes business to invest in capital. Since we all hopefully know that economics is not a zero sum game, the idea is that such investments will spur the economy by directly leading to more economic activity when companies start spending money. In other words, companies SPEND first and, only if they are suc&shy;cessful, reap the profits in the future. More economic activity means more output, more companies, more innova&shy;tions, more jobs.</p>
								<p>Thus, even in the worst case that liberals tend to envision, the benefits to the &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo; will come in the long run and as the result of contributions to our economy. As well known economist Thomas Sowell writes, &ldquo;there has never been any school of economists who believed in a trickle down theory. No such theory can be found in even the most voluminous and learned books on the history of economics.&rdquo; In envisioning economics as such a rigid and inflexible structure, liberals miss the point that tax cuts can and do benefit everyone and on many different, complex levels.</p>
								<p>However, even within this intuitive (and incorrect) understanding of our economy, Bush&rsquo;s tax cut did not go primarily to the wealthy. First, let&rsquo;s consider the most objective aspect of the tax cuts: Bush&rsquo;s restructuring of marginal income tax rates. Bush&rsquo;s proposal is being phased in to restruc&shy;ture the marginal rates when he took office (15-28-31-36-39.6) to a more simplified (10-15-25-33-35). Thus, the creation of a 10% bracket leads to some of the largest cuts going to the &ldquo;poorest of the poor. As a purely objective measure, an individual making around $60,000 a year would therefore receive a much larger tax cut in terms of percentage of income than an individual making $300,000 a year.</p>
								<p>Yet, a change in marginal rates was not the only important aspect of Bush&rsquo;s proposal. Bush&rsquo;s proposal also involved reforming the tax code with regard to capital gains, dividends, and the death/inheritance tax. A number of studies have been conducted as to the actual breakdown of the tax cut as a whole, including these other reforms. Though many are contradictory, it would be fair to say that most indicate Bush&rsquo;s tax cut did not go directly &ldquo;to the rich.&rdquo; Rather, as Steven E. Landsburg of MSN found, the largest portion of the tax cuts in nominal dollars will go to the 2nd (17%) and 3rd (11%) lowest quintiles of the income distribution.</p>
								<p>Tax cuts are a means&#x2026; nothing more, nothing less. There are times when 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											America 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									faces economic hardships that may not be suitably managed with mere monetary policy. In such cases, it may be necessary to use fiscal policy such as a tax cut. Given these realities, one ought to consider whether the tax cuts Bush implemented have been effective in their intended purpose: to pull 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											America 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									out of a recession. Indeed, it does appear that the economy is, on many levels, better than it was during the first year of Bush&rsquo;s term. Therefore, the case appears to have been made, on the basis of empirical evidence, that tax cuts may have saved 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											America 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									from an economic downturn. Let the email debates begin.</p>
