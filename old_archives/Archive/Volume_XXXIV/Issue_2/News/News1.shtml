		  <p>Sometimes being wealthy is complicated. Just ask Stanford University. 
		    The January 18th ASSU Senate bill, 
		    &ldquo;To Ensure Endowment Investment 
		    Responsibility,&rdquo; was passed with a 9-3 
		    majority (with two abstentions), the 
		    bare minimum required. It was written 
		    and sponsored by ASSU Senator and 
		    Chair of the Senate Advocacy Com
		    mittee Omar Shakir, based on pre
		    sentations made to the Senate by The 
		    Stanford Coalition for Investment Dis
		    closure (SCID) and Linda Kimball of 
		    the Stanford Management Company.		    </p>
		  <p>Most contentiously, it proposed that 
		      the &ldquo;Undergraduate Senate strongly 
		      believes that the Board of Trustees 
		      needs to take steps in the direction of 
		      investment disclosure.&rdquo; In a second 
		      vote, without this clause, the bill was 
		      passed unanimously. 
		      As suggested by their name, SCID&rsquo;s 
		      ultimate objective is full disclosure of 
		      the university&rsquo;s investments, in order 
		      to ensure that these investments are 
		      held to socially responsible standards. 
		      Stanford University&rsquo;s endowment of 
		      $10 billion is one of the largest in the 
		      nation, approximately equal to Princeton&rsquo;s and behind only Harvard&rsquo;s and 
		      Yale&rsquo;s, according to recent data. 
		      Most of Stanford&rsquo;s endowment has 
		      been overseen by the Stanford Manage
		      ment Company (SMC) since 1991 in 
		      the Merged Endowment Pool (MEP), 
		      which has boasted stellar and consis
		      tent returns since its inception. 
		      What do I mean by stellar? How about an 18% return for the fiscal year ending June 2004, or a nearly 8% return over the past three years of World Trade Center attacks, severe recession, and war in the Middle East? 
		      And what do I mean by consistent? 
		      How about a ten-year annualized rate 
		      of return hovering above 15%? In cold, 
		      hard assets, that represents a growth in 
		      the MEP from $2.6 billion in June 1994 
		      to more than $10 billion today. 
		      In other words, the fiscal acumen of 
		      the SMC is practically irreproachable.	        </p>
		  <p>This is fortunate for Stanford because 
		      strong performance of the MEP is 
		      integral to the well-being of Stanford 
		      students, current and future. 
		      Although the size of Stanford&rsquo;s 
		      endowment is comparable to the very 
		      best American universities, Stanford is 
		      relatively under-endowed due to the 
		      size and scope of its programs. 
		      Stanford&rsquo;s endowment provides for 
		      only 16% of its operating budget. At 
		      Harvard, the endowment provides 
		      upwards of 32%, and at Princeton, 
		      where the endowment size is more or 
		      less equivalent to Stanford, the endowment provides 36%. Thus endowment 
	        income at Stanford is imperative.</p>
		  <p> The risk of investment disclosure 
		      is the risk of decreased endowment 
		      income: income that is used to pay for 
		      financial aid packages, to attract world
		      class professors, to fund student activi
		      ties and groups, and to ensure that uni
		      versity facilities are up to scratch. 
		      The problem with full investment 
		      disclosure is that it would require the 
		      SMC to reveal its entire investment 
		      strategy, and in effect &ldquo;publicize&rdquo; its 
		      good ideas. As Linda Kimball of the 
		      SMC noted in the San Jose Mercury 
		      News, &ldquo;investment strategy is competi
	        tive.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>If Stanford was forced to disclose 
		      its investments to the public, its com
		      petitive advantage, gained through 
		      comprehensive research and analysis, 
		      would be compromised. Moreover, 
		      the threat of disclosure would almost 
		      certainly deter many hedge funds that 
		      could promise superb returns. 
		      Chief Investment Officer of the 
		      Stanford Management Company, 
		      Mike Ross, explained why full disclosure would diminish the endowment in 
		      an exclusive interview with the Review. &ldquo;One of the challenges with full disclo
		      sure is that most of the highest quality 
		      investment managers require confiden
		      tiality agreements,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;so if Stanford&rsquo;s endowment were fully 
		      disclosed, then Stanford would find it 
		      very difficult to invest in alternative 
		      asset classes, where confidentiality 
		      agreements are prevalent.&rdquo; Alternative 
		      investment classes include most invest
		      ment classes other than stocks and 
	        bonds.</p>
		  <p> According to internal calcu
		      lations at the SMC, if Stanford had 
		      decided 10 years ago to invest under 
		      the conditions of full disclosure &ndash; with
		      out alternative asset classes &ndash; then the 
		      MEP would be about &ldquo;$4.2 billion less 
		      today.&rdquo; 
		      For the future of a university that 
		      wants to offer absolutely the best and 
		      most accessible undergraduate educa
		      tion in the world, full disclosure could 
		      be devastating. 
		    &ldquo;Obviously we all want a strong 
		      endowment,&rdquo; ASSU senator Chris 
		      Nguyen said. Nguyen abstained from voting on the investment disclosure bill because he had reservations with both the political and ethical slant of SCID and also the effect that disclosure could have on Stanford&rsquo;s endowment. The question is whether the potential ethical transparency 
		      to be gained from such a disclosure is worth the risk to Stanford&rsquo;s financial well-being, to students&rsquo; 
		      financial aid packages, tuition and education.Certainly, SCID believes that our ethical responsibility 
		      outweighs the risk, despite assurances from the SMC and others that funds are indeed being invested ethically. But perhaps SCID has a very fixed definition 
	        of ethics. </p>
		  <p>SCID, though they lack a website and are not generally 
	        visible on campus, do not attempt to hide their strong political affiliation. Some of their members are involved in the Stanford Labor Action Coalition, the extreme leftist labor rights group on campus. SCID is also a member of &ldquo;Converge!&rdquo; which bills itself as &ldquo;the home of progressive activism on the farm.&rdquo; And SCID advertises through articles in the Progressive, Stanford&rsquo;s leftist publication, and thus clearly hopes to attract leftist members. </p>
		  <p>There is little question that SCID is a leftist organization. The more important question is whether their requests for disclosure are driven by sincere ethics, or whether they merely serve to mask a political agenda. According to Ryan Schwartz and Anna Mumford in the Progressive, &ldquo;SCID is part [of] UnFarallon, a national coalition of progressive NGO student groups that are also pressuring their universities for investment disclosure.&rdquo; UnFarallon bills itself as &ldquo;a coalition of national and campus-based organizations seeking to make private capital more transparent, and more socially and environmentally responsible.</p>
		  <p>&rdquo;It has taken aim at Farallon Capital Management LLC, one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most successful hedge funds. Farallon is run by Thomas Steyer, an alumnus of Stanford&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business. Farallon manages a portion of Stanford&rsquo;s assets, but SCID believes that Farallon may be managing those assets irresponsibly. UnFarallon, however, clearly has a political agenda beyond &ldquo;investment disclosure&rdquo; and &ldquo;ethics.&rdquo; Its website 
		      sponsors read like a who&rsquo;s who list of leftist student 
		      organizations, including the Student Environmental 
	        Action Coalition and Students Transforming and Resisting Corporation (STARC). </p>
		  <p>STARC in particular 
		      advocates a radical socialist agenda, declaring in its mission statement a determination to &ldquo;challenge a social and economic system that exploits resources while reinforcing privilege and oppression,&rdquo; and providing 
	      links to the Young Communist League and the Young Democratic Socialists. Nguyen worries that SCID would use investment disclosure to advocate a leftist political agenda. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that [SCID] is truly liberal.&rdquo;Nguyen also remarked that ethical investing is not a matter of black and white. </p>
		  <p>&ldquo;Ethics is in the eye of the beholder,&rdquo; he notes. &ldquo;There is some reason behind the ethical concerns of SCID, but what do the ethical concerns constitute?&rdquo; He offered the example of investment in companies that do business in Israel. To some, such an investment might be considered unethical. But the same leftists might not object to a company that did business in oppressive socialist Venezuela. For his part, ASSU bill-sponsor Shakir said that he would be an &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; to ignore the fact that many of SCID&rsquo;s members are liberal.</p></td>
