		  <p>President George W. Bush returned from Europe this week with assurances 
		    from allies that they are united with the United States on important security issues. Mr. Bush was able to secure important European assistance with training Iraqi security personnel 
		    and general reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, as European leaders united with the president in condemning Syria and Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions.Meeting with NATO, the European Union, and various state leaders in Belgium, Germany, and Slovakia, Mr. Bush and his allies praised the historic bond across the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
		  <p>The president thanked European leaders for the support they had given in Afghanistan 
		      and Iraq and declared that &ldquo;there should be no doubt in your mind that my government and the United States want the European project to succeed. It&rsquo;s in our interests that Europe be strong.&rdquo; Recognition and support for the European Union was a particularly important issue for the Europeans as they hoped to gain symbolic US confidence 
	        on the project.In Brussels, the president was able to secure the unanimous support of NATO, which vowed to redouble its assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
		  <p>The agreement is significant because it includes commitments from France and a handful of other European countries 
		      that opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq. Germany had already been training Iraqi security forces in the United Arab Emirates.According to an official news release from NATO, &ldquo;all 26 Allies are now contributing to NATO&rsquo;s training of Iraqi security forces, either in Iraq, outside of Iraq, through financial contributions 
	        or donations of equipment.&rdquo;</p>
		  <p>This statement echoes the organization&rsquo;s earlier commitment 
		      in June 2004 to train Iraqi security forces, as well as its leadership 
		      of the International Security Assistance 
		      Force in Afghanistan, support for the Multinational 
		      Division in Iraq, and deployment of air defense units to Turkey. The overwhelming 
		      majority of NATO members 
		      supported the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, with France and Germany mounting the core opposition.The European Union also agreed to train roughly seven hundred Iraqis in judicial-related capacities, Javier Solana, 
	        the EU&rsquo;s foreign policy spokesman, told the Associated Press.</p>
		  <p>&ldquo;We are for the first time really united on Iraq,&rdquo; he said. The EU has promised $3 million towards this effort.Speaking in Belgium&rsquo;s Concert Noble Ballroom, Mr. Bush described the trans-Atlantic bond as &ldquo;the main pillar of our security&rdquo; and pointed to peace in the Middle East as the &ldquo;greatest 
	        opportunity and immediate goal.&rdquo; Acknowledging differences over the invasion of Iraq, the president said, &ldquo;Now is the time for established democracies to give tangible political, economic and security assistance to the world&rsquo;s newest democracy.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>The president&rsquo;s visit to Brussels came one week after the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Dining with French President Jacques Chirac, 
		      Bush emphasized the importance 
		      of the Franco-American relationship and issued a joint statement 
		      calling upon Syria to abide by UN resolutions 
		      to withdraw security and intelligence forces from Lebanon. Amid the international 
		      pressure and massive protests in Lebanon that led to the fall of the Syrian 
	        puppet regime in Beirut, Syrian President Bashar Assad has agreed to withdraw the troops &ldquo;within a few months.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>France and the US want the immediate 
		      withdraw of the Syrians so that the Lebanese people can hold free elections without Syrian interference.On February 23, President Bush met with German Chancellor Gerhard 
		      Schr&ouml;eder. Reminding those listening that Germany helped waive Iraqi national debt, Schr&ouml;eder also mentioned that his nation could assist further in reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country. On the subject of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions, the two leaders spoke with one voice, with Schr&ouml;eder stating &ldquo;we absolutely agree that Iran must say, no, to any kind of nuclear weapon, full stop.&rdquo;The president received his warmest reception at Wiesbaden Army Airfield Base in Germany, where he expressed his thanks and pride in the work the military has done. Among those soldiers 
	        in the audience were veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
		  <p> Addressing the First Armored Division, the commander- 
		      in-chief said amid thunderous applause, &ldquo;I was the guy serving turkey,&rdquo; 
		      referring to his 2003 Thanksgiving 
		      surprise visit to troops in Baghdad.The last leg of the presidential trip ended in Slovakia where Mr. Bush was to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking outside in Bratislava to a massive Slovak crowd that turned out despite freezing weather, Mr. Bush thanked them for their support in Afghanistan and Iraq. The president also reminded Slovaks of &ldquo;the exhilaration of voting for the first time after decades of tyranny,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;as you watched jubilant Iraqis dancing in the streets last month, holding up ink-stained fingers, you remembered Velvet Days,&rdquo; referring to their successful 
	        democratic movement.</p>
		  <p>The president&rsquo;s visit to Europe ended with a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Bratislava, where, according to Mr. Bush, they had &ldquo;very frank discussions about a variety of issues.&rdquo; The US has grown increasingly 
		      concerned about the rollback of democratic institutions in Russia and Moscow&rsquo;s commitment to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear 
	      program. President Putin denied Iran would use its program to produce nuclear weapons and agreed it should not acquire them, vowing to &ldquo;put an end to the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.&rdquo;</p></td>
