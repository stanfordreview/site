		  <p>Here at Stanford we have recently 
		    had the opportunity to examine the 
		    catastrophic events occurring in the 
		    Darfur region of the Sudan. As last 
		    week&rsquo;s visit by Sudanese ambassa
		    dor Khidir Haroun Ahmed clearly 
		    showed, however, two very different 
		    stories about this situation are circulat
		    ing throughout the international com
		    munity as a whole. One side, promoted emphatically 
		    by the Bush administration, the U.S. 
		    Congress, the Parliament of the 
		    European Union, and government and NGO officials from around the 
		    world, notes with alarm the violent 
		    campaigns of arson, murder, torture, 
		    and rape carried out by the Sudanese 
		    government in collaboration with the 
		    Arab Janjaweed militias. For months 
		    it has condemned the events as a 
		    genocide now approaching Rwanda 
		    in scale. </p>
		  <p>In the spring of 2004 Jan 
		      Egeland, U.N. Under-Secretary for 
		      Humanitarian Affairs, repeatedly 
		      insisted that the violence against the 
		      Darfurians was &ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo; 
		      (although the U.N.&rsquo;s official position 
		      on the issue has changed noticeably 
		      since then). The other story, offered 
		      by Mr. Ahmed, staunchly refuses to 
		      recognize the reality of genocide, dig
		      nifying Sudanese government actions 
		      as &ldquo;counter-insurgency warfare.&rdquo; Ahmed is not alone. For months, 
		      the African Union has refused to 
		      declare the tragedy a genocide, send
		      ing a token number of monitoring 
		      personnel (as of Febuary 6, 2005, only 
		      1400) which falls pitifully short of its 
		      planned deployment (3500 to 4000) 
		      and of the ability to do the least bit of 
		      good in protecting the victims of geno
	        cide. </p>
		  <p>Often the best these AU &ldquo;protecttion&rdquo; forces can do is idly watch the 
		      atrocities occuring in front of them. 
		      African countries of the Arab 
		      League have also sided with Khar
		      toum, deferring to the government&rsquo;s 
		    &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; when faced with the 
		      question of whether to send in outside 
		      aid. Following an October 2004 sum
		      mit, the heads of Chad, Egypt, Libya, 
		      and Nigeria issued a joint statement 
		      stressing their &ldquo;rejection of all foreign 
		      intervention in this purely African 
	        question.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>This position falls in line 
		      with Khartoum&rsquo;s repeated insistence 
		      that the international community has 
		      somehow twisted the truth to vilify 
		      the Sudanese government; that instead, 
		      rebel forces that have attacked military 
		      targets and police are to blame for the 
		      justifiable government crackdown. Most dismaying&mdash;but predictable&mdash;is 
		      the reaction of U.N. Secretary-Gen
		      eral Kofi Annan, who seems muddled 
	        over which side to believe.</p>
		  <p> In June 
		      2004 Mr. Annan asserted that he is &ldquo;serious about preventing genocide&rdquo;, 
		      even warning of future military inter
		      vention in Darfur, but he has yet to 
		      back his rhetoric with any meaning
		      ful actions. In fact, after receiving a 
		      report compiled by the International 
		      Commission of Inquiry on Darfur on 
		      January 1st, 2005, Annan declared &ldquo;I 
		      am not ready to describe [Darfur] as 
	        genocide or ethnic cleansing yet.&rdquo; </p>
		  <p>This 
		      U.N. report, while emphasizing the 
		      grave degree of the humanitarian crisis 
		      in Darfur, takes painstaking measures 
		      not to label the situation genocide. Unfortunately, close inspection of the 
		      report reveals that the authors meticu
		      lously omitted the most serious crimes 
		      committed in Darfur, opting instead 
		      to use shaky logic to circumvent the 
		      awful truth of the situation.	        </p>
		  <p>The U.N. Commission report on 
		      Darfur explicitly states that in addition 
		      to numerous aerial assaults on villages 
		      conducted by the government military 
		      and the Janjaweed, &ldquo;(h)undreds of 
		      incidents have been reported involv
		      ing the killing of civilians, massacres, 
		      summary executions, rape and other 
		      forms of sexual violence, torture, 
		      abduction, looting of property and 
		      livestock, as well as deliberate destruc
		      tion and torching of villages. These 
		      incidents have resulted in the massive 
		      displacement of large parts of the civil
		      ian population within Darfur as well as 
		      to neighboring Chad.&rdquo; 
		      It goes on to conclude that &ldquo;(e)xcept 
		      in a few cases, these incidents are 
		      reported to have occurred without any 
		      military justification in relation to any 
		      specific activity of rebel forces.&rdquo;	        </p>
		  <p>Additionally, after observing that &ldquo;such attacks were also intended to 
		      spread terror among civilians so as to 
		      compel them to flee the villages&hellip;&rdquo; and 
		      that &ldquo;(i)n a majority of cases, victims of 
		      the attacks belonged to African tribes, 
		      in particular the Fur, Massalit and 
		      Zaghawa tribes&rdquo; the authors ultimately 
		      conclude that the tragedies occurring 
		      in Darfur should be classified as &ldquo;large
		      scale war crimes.&rdquo; 
		      All of these descriptions seem to fit 
		      perfectly under the definition of geno
		      cide outlined in the 1948 Convention 
		      on the Prevention and Punishment of 
	        the Crime of Genocide. </p>
		  <p>The authors&rsquo; 
		      refusal to classify it as such becomes 
		      even more astonishing given their 
		      further assertions in the report: &ldquo;One 
		      should not rule out the possibility that 
		      in some instances single individuals 
		      including Government officials, may 
		      entertain a genocidal intent&rdquo;, how
		      ever &ldquo;if any single individual&hellip;has such 
		      intent it would be for a competent 
		      court to make such a determination on a case-by-case basis&rdquo;. Sudanese Vice
		      President Ali Osman Taha has already 
		      publicly declared Khartoum&rsquo;s staunch 
		      opposition to trying any Sudanese official indicted in Darfur crimes in a court 
		      outside of the Sudan. In statements like these, the report 
		      does all but confirm the Darfur atrocities as genocide. </p>
		  <p>This position seems 
		      even more astonishing given the fact 
		      that the authors worked with very 
		      incomplete evidence. U.N. officials 
		      were not allowed access to mass grave 
		      sites in Darfur until after the govern
		      ment had declared these sites &ldquo;secure.&rdquo; Darfurian human rights groups have 
		      received security documents detailing 
		      the government destruction of eight mass grave sites, including the names of 
	        various officers involved. </p>
		  <p>Members of 
		      the U.N. investigative committee were 
		      never allowed into the region of Wadi 
		      Saleh, where some of the worst mas
		      sacres have taken place. Many of the 
		      report&rsquo;s claims grossly misrepresent 
		      the true nature of both the government 
		      attacks and the horrific living condi
		      tions which millions of displaced Dar
		      furians now must endure. The list of 
		      flaws goes on and on. (To read in more 
		      detail about the report&rsquo;s numerous failings, see Eric Reeve&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report of International Commission of Inquiry on 
		      Darfur, February 2, 2005&rdquo; Parts I and 
	        II at http://www.sudanreeves.org.)</p>
		  <p> The facts of the situation undeniably classify the events of Darfur as genocide, revealing any refusal to recognize them as such as self-interested political accommodation. If the U.N. report had declared a &ldquo;genocide,&rdquo; Mr. Annan would have been obligated by stipulations of the 1948 Genocide Convention to lead the U.N. into real, material steps against the violence. This would have landed him in conflict with China, which has veto power in the Security Council and significant oil interests vested in the Sudan. Unfortunately for the mil
		      lions of Darfurians living in mortal peril, too many at the U.N. are will
	      ing to sacrifice the truth for political convenience. It is a very old story.</p></td>
