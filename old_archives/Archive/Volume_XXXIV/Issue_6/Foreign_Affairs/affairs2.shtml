								<p>The White House remains firmly behind controversial diplomat John Bolton, who President Bush nomi&shy;nated to be the next 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											US 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									ambassador to the United Nations. His final vote has been postponed until May 12 due to allegations regarding 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									&rsquo;s famous temper. Democrats have charged him with being abusive towards subor&shy;dinates and exceedingly harsh in his criticism toward the United Nations. These allegations have saturated media coverage, but other worthy aspects of the battle over 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									&rsquo;s nomination have largely been ignored.</p>
								<p>The Associated Press headline, for example, picked up by scores of news&shy;papers around the world was &ldquo;59 ex-diplomats oppose 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									nomination.&rdquo; These diplomats, including such figures as former Democratic presidential can&shy;didate Carol Mosley-Braun, declared in a March 29 letter to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) that Bolton &ldquo;cannot be an effective promoter of the 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											U.S. 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									national interest at the UN.&rdquo; Citing his opposition to many international treaties, the group slammed Bolton&rsquo;s support for a democratic 
									<st1:country-region w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											Taiwan 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:country-region>
									.</p>
								<p>Shows of support from 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									allies went relatively unreported. Some have compared him to former representa&shy;tives to the UN like Jeane Kirkpatrick and the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, widely heralded as effec&shy;tive promoters of American interests at the world body. Led by the Center for Security Policy, a list of Bolton supporters including 
									<st1:City w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											Hoover 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:City>
									fellows Edwin Meese, Abraham Sofaer, and Peter Robinson, had grown to 92 national security experts by April 13. This letter, also sent to Senator Lugar, suggested that the anti-Bolton diplo&shy;mats had more differences with Presi&shy;dent Bush than with 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									and said that he is &ldquo;one of (Bush&rsquo;s) most effec&shy;tive and articulate officials in advancing (White House) policies.&rdquo; This group joined five former secretaries of state, including 
									<st1:City w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											Hoover 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:City>
									fellow George Schul&shy;tz, in announcing their support for the embattled nominee. A further 53 for&shy;mer ambassadors wrote Sen. Lugar on April 12, stating: &ldquo;No one in the world has a better grounding of proven expe&shy;rience than John Bolton.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>But what has many opponents of 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									angry is his unilateral tenden&shy;cies, as they call it. How &ldquo;unilateral&rdquo; 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									actually is has been the subject of much debate between supporters and those opposing his nomination. 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									attempted to bring to light his work as a multilateralist in his prepared remarks to the Senate Committee. He hailed the Proliferation Security Initia&shy;tive, which he helped craft, as a &ldquo;coali&shy;tion of more than 60 countries to help combat the spread of dangerous weap&shy;ons.&rdquo; Furthermore, he pledged to work within a multinational framework to alleviate humanitarian crises.</p>
								<p>Critics were not convinced. Barbara Boxer stated, &ldquo;I think Mr. Bolton needs anger management at a minimum.&rdquo; Boxer was referring to his well-known and controversial tendencies to say what is on his mind. For example, his tough talk towards Kim Jong-Il, a &ldquo;tyrannical dictator,&rdquo; earned him a derisive moniker from the North Korean government: &ldquo;human scum.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Just this past week, it was revealed former Secretary of State Colin Powell had been in contact with several Sena&shy;tors on the foreign relations committee in order to give them a frank assess&shy;ment of 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									. According to sources familiar with the conversations Powell was supportive of Bolton&rsquo;s abilities to be an effective diplomat, but expressed his concern regarding 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									&rsquo;s person&shy;ality. Powell is the only former Repub&shy;lican Secretary of State not to sign a letter of support for 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									.</p>
								<p>Making the situation worse for 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									and the White House, criticism and dissent has started to emerge from the GOP. Senator Lincoln Chafee (R-RI) has previously said he was inclined to cast a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; vote in favor of Bolton, but now feels the &lsquo;dynamic has changed.&rsquo; The Republican Sena&shy;tor from 
									<st1:State w:st="on">
										Ohio 
									</st1:State>
									, George Voinovich, surprised everyone when he requested that the vote be delayed so that all the allegations against 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									could be thoroughly investigated by the com&shy;mittee. Additionally, Chuck Hagel (R-NE) has hinted that he may vote against 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									if the allegations are left unresolved or more emerge.</p>
								<p>As of now, the vote on Bolton&rsquo;s nomination is set for May 12, but that could quickly change if more allegations against him surface or if his nomination is withdrawn by the White House, or if 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Bolton 
									</st1:place>
									withdraws himself from consideration.</p>
