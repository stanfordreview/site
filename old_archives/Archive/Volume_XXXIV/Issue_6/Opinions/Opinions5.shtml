								<p>Undeniably, 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										Northern California 
									</st1:place>
									is an ideologically liberal place. Conser&shy;vatives are certainly in the minority. A survey done several years back by the Stanford College Republicans found that only 20 percent of Stanford stu&shy;dents claim to be conservative. A more recent study, published by the <i>Palo Alto Weekly </i>in February 2005, showed that there are 7.6 Democrats in the Stanford faculty for every Republican. Retaining and fighting for conservative ideals can be a challenge. Despite the enormous political inequity, ambi&shy;tious and concerned conservatives can both thrive and find their place on the farm.</p>
								<p>Although I am just completing my first year as an undergraduate student at Stanford, I have already experienced many of the ups and downs of campus political life. I can still remember my days of &ldquo;closet conservatism.&rdquo; At first, few other students knew that I aligned myself on the right side of the political spectrum. The overwhelm&shy;ing liberal atmosphere and my fear of being socially ostracized warranted total confidentiality. I even turned-off the &ldquo;political views&rdquo; section of my facebook profile in an effort to evade fanatic facebook stalkers.</p>
								<p>Thankfully, I had my day of enlight&shy;enment. I can still remember it vividly. I believe I said something politically revealing in IHUM section. Immedi&shy;ately thereafter, a whisper comes from behind me. My classmate asks me, &ldquo;Are you one of us?&rdquo; I respond, &ldquo;who?&rdquo; He answers: &ldquo;conservatives.&rdquo; I divulged my deep secret, and hence began my adventure in campus politics.</p>
								<p>I soon learned that there are more conservatives on campus than I origi&shy;nally thought. At least two more turned up in that same IHUM section and a significant number in my own dorm&#151;including the Editor-in-Chief of <i>The Stanford Review</i>. People began to sympathize with my political ideas and viewpoints. More importantly, they encouraged me to actively propagate my ideology and challenge the beliefs of others. I began to enjoy a whole new aspect of university life.</p>
								<p>My new motivation to actively engage in Stanford&rsquo;s political scene later crystallized into several articles for <i>The Review </i>and an ASSU Senate bid. One of the later articles, released right before the election, detailed an investigation I conducted on the Black Student Union&rsquo;s disproportionate representation in the ASSU and the amount of funding they receive from General Fees. The article caused a huge political backslash from the black com&shy;munity and the liberal establishment on campus. Large numbers of e-mails circulated asking students to not vote for me in the coming election and <i>The Stanford Daily </i>subsequently published a staff editorial entitled, &ldquo;Conservatives deserve a better paper than <i>The Review</i>.&rdquo; I ended-up finishing last in the election and even lost the endorsement of the Stanford College Republicans.</p>
								<p>Race politics, I quickly learned, is not an issue most university students are willing to discuss. Unlike most power establishments, students are afraid to challenge the legitimacy of race-orient&shy;ed groups. Deplorably, many people dismissed the facts that I presented. Students claimed that the article was of biased, sensationalized, and even implicitly racist. Although I chal&shy;lenged objectors to reveal specific facts that bothered them, the few e-mails I received only took issue with the way in which I presented facts. In short, I was greatly distressed with the state of intellectual diversity at Stanford. Race, in my view, prevented many students from engaging in rational discourse that I would expect and enjoy.</p>
								<p>In the end, only one group of stu&shy;dents stood behind my investigation&#151;<i>The Review </i>itself. Although my expe&shy;riences in race and politics were not ideal, I certainly discovered that there is a demand for conservatives willing to challenge the current norm of campus liberalism at Stanford. <i>The Review </i>is the home for these crusaders.</p>
								<p>However, students&#151;especially the prospective freshman visiting this weekend&#151;need to seriously consider enjoying the university experience as an &ldquo;extroverted conservative.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t be timid or shy to express your dis&shy;content with a professor&rsquo;s teaching methods, investment disclosure, for&shy;eign policy, or other issues. Generally, Stanford students are very receptive to opposing viewpoints. Even if you encounter resistance&#151;you can count on <i>The Review </i>as a friend.</p>
