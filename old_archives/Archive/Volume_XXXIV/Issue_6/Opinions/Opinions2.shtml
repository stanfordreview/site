								<p>In the recent weeks, some have leveled the criticism that <i>The Review </i>is a &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; &ldquo;rag tag&rdquo; &ldquo;tabloid pro&shy;duction.&rdquo; Others have suggested that <i>The Review </i>has become too politicized. Therefore, I thought I might use my column this week to write on something that is neither &ldquo;right wing&rdquo; nor blatantly &ldquo;political.&rdquo; What might I be referring to?</p>
								<p>Well, it has come to my attention that there are those who consider Stanford students to be snobby, stuck up, arrogant jerks. To be honest, I can see how the stereotype might hold some water. Sometimes it is far too easy to come off as arrogant, when in reality one&rsquo;s goal is to merely address issues logically.</p>
								<p>For example, without naming any names, I recently ran across a group stationed in 
									<st1:place w:st="on">
										<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
											White 
										</st1:PlaceName>
										<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
											Plaza 
										</st1:PlaceType>
									</st1:place>
									thatsought to draw attention to a particular public policy issue. I was given a terse and inevitably biased background on the issue at hand and then asked to pledge my support. Now, I have never been one to accept propositions at face value &#150; particularly issues of public policy. Yet, the case seemed convincing enough and so I ultimately gave my support to the particular cause.</p>
								<p>Of course, I couldn&rsquo;t stop there. I proceeded to ask several more questions about the potential ramifications of this particular policy. It seems that these individuals did not want to hear about, or even consider the possibility that their ideas might backfire. Indeed, their message sounded strikingly similar to Paul Wolfowitz&rsquo;s (ultimately incorrect) estimations of the ramifications of the Iraq War. After no more than two questions I was told to leave. After probing further I was met with dead silence. I ask, then, is this the sort of dialog we wish to have on a campus that is supposedly devoted to the &ldquo;winds of freedom?&rdquo; Or, is a twelve-second brain washed sales pitch the basis upon which we ought to determine our vari&shy;ous policy positions? Indeed, it would seem that if an individual has made the decision to &ldquo;raise political awareness&rdquo; with regard to certain policy issues, that individual ought to also have the will&shy;ingness to accept criticism and respond to those criticisms with the intention of educating and/or presenting new information. As many have signaled, internal hubris may mark the downfall of our great civilization.</p>
								<p>Along a similar line, the <i>Review&rsquo;s </i>recent criticism has fallen into two categories: legitimate and illegitimate. In evaluating my own personal response, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of the sign hanging on the window of a barber shop in downtown 
									<st1:City w:st="on">
										<st1:place w:st="on">
											Palo Alto 
										</st1:place>
									</st1:City>
									. It reads: &ldquo;Attention teenagers: Are you tired of your stupid parents always telling you what to do and how to live your life?</p>
								<p>Well take action! Move out, get a job, pay all of your own bills, while you still know everything!&rdquo; Though clich&eacute;, as much as I hate to admit it, this year has taught me that I don&rsquo;t know everything. In fact, it is quite possible that my knowledge of any given area might be dwarfed by that of my political sci&shy;ence classmates. But, not only do I lack all the answers&#x2026;you do too! In fact, I would wager to say that any given individual, no matter how brilliant, is inevitably confined to knowing only a finite number of things. Yet, information is infinite. That is why I would like to see more positive discourse on campus. That is why I would also like to propose my own &ldquo;contract with Stanford:&rdquo; ONE (1): I pledge to respond constructively to any emails sent to my email address at <a href="mailto:opinions@stanfordreview.org">opinions@stanfordreview.org</a> on the basis that TWO (2): those emails are responded to in a similarly constructive tone.</p>
								<p>My contract notwithstanding, to be honest, I feel that Stanford generally does do an excellent job in fostering an intellectually open-minded environ&shy;ment. Stanford stares into the infinite abyss of potential knowledge and treks on, knowing that its value does not lie in achieving a definite end, but in the pursuit itself. Thus, it is with a great sense of pride and honor that I claim to be affiliated with this university. Using the same rationale, I also feel that <i>The Review </i>plays an integral role in presenting alternative perspectives and ideas in the pursuit of knowledge. If you disagree, I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
