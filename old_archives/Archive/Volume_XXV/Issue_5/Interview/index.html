<font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+2>Interview with President Hennessy</font><br>

<b>
John L. Hennessy is the tenth president of Stanford University.  He became an associate professor in the Stanford computer science department in 1977 after receiving a doctorate and master's from SUNY Stony Brook and an undergraduate degree at Villanova University.  He was named dean of the School of Engineering in 1996 before becoming provost in 1999.  He was selected as president following the departure of Gerhard Casper in 2000.

TSR:  Many see a trend in higher education that university presidents are becoming increasingly alienated from the academic affairs of their institutions in favor of fundraising and management.  Does this correspond to your own assessment of your job at Stanford?  Do you see yourself as a CEO?<p>

Mr. Hennessy:  I see myself first and foremost as a member of the faculty.  I think there has been increasing tension between the president's focus on academic affairs and the president's focus on a variety of external affairs.  Fundraising certainly is a part of that, but not the only part of it, I think.  Dealing with the outside community and government officials has certainly become a big job for all university presidents, especially presidents of public institutions, or presidents of universities going through things like the General Use Permit process we've just been through.  And I think that's a tension.  I think it's also a danger.  I think whether you're doing fundraising or whether you're communicating with public officials about university plans, or whether you're thinking about how to make strategic management decisions inside the university, the key to making all those decisions is to understand how they impinge on the academic program at it's core, so I think it's important for university presidents to stay in touch with the faculty and students and the core academic program.<p>

TSR:  When future historians reflect upon the Hennessy years, what would you like them to say?<p>

Mr. Hennessy: Ah, that's a good question.  Well, I think this probably is a time of opportunity for Stanford, so I'd like first and foremost for them to say that we did as an institution take advantage of that opportunity during our time.  More specifically, I think I'd like them to hopefully say that this is a time when our increased commitment and increased attention to the undergraduate program started under Gerhard's leadership, continues to flourish.  And that we continue to make enhancements and continue to build the best possible undergraduate program.  I also have had the feeling that it's a time when more and more of our research is becoming interdisciplinary in nature, and I would like to think that we will make progress on a variety of fronts; we're obviously doing things with the Bio X and the Quark center there, but we're also doing things in the humanities and the social sciences, in the environmental area to promote more interdisciplinary studies and take advantage of the breadth of Stanford as an institution and its many strengths.  And I'd like to think that there will be some evidence that we've made some clear progress.  Whether that be new-standing research programs pr whether it be changes in the process so that new areas that are multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary can be pursued more quickly.  I would hope all of those would be part of that.<p> 

TSR: How do you respond to those who charge Stanford with being an overpriced trade school?<p>

<img  src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXV/Issue_5/Interview/images/hennessy_podium.jpg" width=125 height=133 alt="Hennessy" align=left>
Mr. Hennessy: I think it's an interesting accusation.  I would never argue that Stanford is a trade school.  If we were trying to become a trade school, we would eliminate the humanities core, we would not have added the language requirement, certainly wouldn't have freshman seminars or sophomore college.  In fact, I think just the opposite is true.  Even when you look at engineering and the sciences we have built a program which very much has the feeling of a technical or scientific education in the context of a liberal arts environment and a liberal arts education.  So I think we've distinctly not moved in that direction, and I don't think we have any intention to move in that direction.  I've always taken the view that your undergraduate education is about building a foundation for your life.  It's not about training <i>per se</i>.<p>

	So I don't think we are in a training mission.  I think we're engaged in education, and I've always believed that what students should engage themselves in at Stanford are things that will build a foundation for learning for the rest of their life.  So that when they need to learn a particular skill, they'll have developed the methodology and the knowledge of how to acquire that skill quite quickly.  It's unimportant to teach the training mission because as people progress in their careers and as they learn, first of all, the skills they'll need will change. <p>

TSR:  This year's Gaieties, as you know, received a lot of criticism for a scene that offended a number of Native Americans.  Did you feel comfortable appearing in the show with particular groups of students airing complaints about its content?<p>

Mr. Hennessy:  As you know it's traditional the Gaieties script is a deep, dark secret.  So I hadn't seen the script, and I actually didn't see the scene because I didn't watch the whole show until the last night.  When I found that there were some Native Americans who were offended by this particular scene I asked my staff, and Dean Montoya also worked on the issue, to try to get the two groups together and talk about it.  And I think once the students performing in Gaieties understood why the scene was viewed as offensive by the Native American community, then they were happy to modify it.  And so the night I actually saw it, the offensive scene was gone.  There has to be a sensitivity also to not putting in a scene that picks on a particular group to the extent that they feel it crosses the line between humor and being offensive in some way.  For something like Gaieties it is obviously sarcastic.  It's a tricky thing to get right.  I was happy to see that when the students got together and discuss the issue, they could resolve it in a peaceful way.<p>

TSR:  How do you feel about the University's general position on affirmative action in admissions, hiring, and tenure?  Would you change it in any way?<p>

Mr. Hennessy:  I wouldn't change the policy.  I would distinguish between how we use affirmative action in the admissions policy and how we use it in faculty recruiting.  In the admissions policy I think affirmative action has two roles, shall we say, that it plays.  One is that I think we feel quite strongly there are significant benefits to the institution and to our student body as a whole by having a very diverse student body.  A student body that's diverse in socio-economic status, where they grew up geographically, whether it's inner city or it's urban, or it's suburban, or rural, I think also a student body that's racially, religiously diverse in many ways.  And I think that's valuable because that reflects what we are as a country, and it is a way for students to learn how to live and survive and prosper in a country which is increasingly diverse.  <p>

At the faculty level, I think we are looking to increase the diversity of our faculty simply to increase the diversity of viewpoints and to create a faculty which more closely reflects a mix we have in the student body.  Affirmative action at the time of hiring is really about casting the net more widely, about being opportunistic particularly in fields where either women or minorities are dramatically underrepresented.  And I think that is a place where being opportunistic is exactly the right approach and where if you would like to have a more diverse faculty you need to try to take advantage of those situations.  I think at tenure time our goal is simply to have one standard so that we don't discriminate either positively or negatively against anybody at tenure time. And we make the decision on the basis quality irrespective of other issues.  <p>

TSR:  What are you r greatest concerns for the undergraduate curriculum, and, more specifically, what role should the study of Western Civilization play in the curriculum?<p>

Mr. Hennessy:  My greatest concerns?  I think one concern I have is maintaining the tremendous advancements that have been made in the last few years.  We have put a tremendous amount of money into developing a new IHUM core that I think has really come a long way, and you can see the response of the students to the new Introduction to the Humanities core.  I think the challenge is not creating that core the first time or creating the new courses but in maintaining that at a very high level.  I think similarly, maintaining the quality and diversity that we offer in freshman seminars, sophomore college…those are all going to be challenges.  And I guess what I worry about there  is that we've now created a set of expectations and a level of excellence which I think is remarkably improved over what it once was.  And now we have to maintain it.  All parts of curriculum are subject to a process of renewal and revival and renaissance.  And I think maintaining that pace and that attention to the process I think is key - maintaining something that's vigorous and interesting and exciting and lively.   <p>

	I think the other issue for us to ask in the undergraduate curriculum is: much of our attention over the last five, six, seven, years has been on the first two years.  It's time to begin to think about and begin to lay plans for what we do in the next two years. <p>

	The other thing I think we'd like to do is we'd like to see a significant increase in the opportunities for independent study, honors college, and research for undergraduates.  I think with that we can build an undergraduate program which is as good as any undergraduate program in the country.  And it builds on the true strengths and depths of the institution.<p>
