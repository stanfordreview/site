Staff Writer<p>

	The dreaded "H-word" struck again on January 19th, as the obsession of comparing Stanford to Harvard and the other Ivy League schools continued at the ASSU Presidential Selection Forum.
<p>
	Held in the Cypress Room of the Tresidder Student Union, the dialogue between Stanford community members and the Presidential Selection Committee centered around a contemplation of whether Stanford should strive to perpetuate its self-perceived uniqueness or model itself in the image of the east coast Universities that many of its students passed up to come to Stanford.
  
	Few attended the forum despite ASSU publication efforts: a front-page article in the Stanford Daily, e-mail to the R.A. list, and campus-wide flyer distribution.  The forum, according to ASSU President Mike Levin, was meant to assist the Selection Committee in "seeing as broad an opinion as possible from many different students to determine what they want from the next University President."  A small number of Stanford undergraduate and Graduate students did present a variety of opinions to the Presidential Selection Committee.  
<p>
	The Committee, comprised of seven members—four students, two faculty members and one trustee, is charged with the task of selecting Gerhard Casper's successor.  Because the selection of a new university president is a rare event, none of the Selection Committee members have previously faced such a task.  On Wednesday night they sought the guidance of the Stanford community.
<p>
	As the evening progressed, the discussion became more of a construction of a mythical ideal university than an expression of concrete qualities the Stanford community would like to see in their next President.
<p>
	The Selection Committee took copious notes of what became a Stanford Community Wishlist.  With luck, the committee will be able to synthesize these wishes into a vision of what kind of person they should search out to fill Casper's shoes.  According to those present at the Forum an ideal President would…
<p>
	1. Actively search out and tenure female and minority faculty members with a special focus on the Engineering and Science Graduate Schools.<br>
	2. Alleviate the present campus-wide obsession with pre-professionalism and spark a renewed passion for pure academic endeavors.<br>
	3. Have a mind-set that does not reflect the typical "old-white male" stereotype.<br>
	4. Pursue improvements in the quality of graduate student life.  Aside from the University's unique difficulties with housing costs, other quality of life factors need be considered:  health care, child care and miscellaneous costs of living.  In order to maintain a competitive and blue chip graduate student population, graduate life at Stanford should be attractive or at least moderately desirable.<br>
	5. Extend the University policy of Need-Blind Financial Aid to International Students.<br>
	6. Promote diversity on the Stanford campus (no surprise here).
<p>
		What was surprising in the diversity debate, however, was the multiple approaches to diversity considered - not only ethnic diversity but also academic diversity.  A number of students pleaded the case for diversity by requesting a University President who would bolster support for and clear up misconceptions regarding Theme Houses.  Another student countered that diversity would be better served by making undergraduate housing more homogeneous in nature: removing students of various ethnic identities from Theme Houses and distributing them amongst other students in typical dorms.  This strategy would achieve diversity by encouraging students who would normally stick to Theme Houses to expose their new dorm-mates to their cultural identities.
<p>
	Others brought up the question of academic diversity.  Have you ever submersed yourself in a debate of Aristotelian philosophies that stretched into the wee hours of the morning?  Many Stanfordites have not.  Yet, it is an experience that the glossy Stanford Brochures promises every Undergraduate.
<p>
	Does that kind of engaging academic zealotry really exist here at Stanford?  A former participant in the freshmen Structured Liberal Education program assured the Committee that such conversations frequently take place over meals and late nights at the Florence Moore Residential Complex where the SLE students are clustered.
<p>
	The debate took an interesting turn when a student suggested that disbanding SLE and spreading its outgoing academically and philosophically inclined frosh amongst the rest of the apparently under-stimulated frosh might make that academic interest universal.  But is it possible that the SLE students are so different from their classmates?
<p>
	It seems more likely that the uniform nature of their humanities education—they all read the same literary works simultaneously— causes their ability to participate in such impressive academic debates.  Meanwhile, the remaining frosh are spread out over ten Introduction to Humanities courses, all reading varied works.  While opening an IHUM brochure to see ten course choices might seem like academic diversity—a diversity of choice—it does not necessarily create a thriving and stimulating academic environment.
<p>
	How can Stanford become a perfect university?  Should it follow the system of many colleges within a university that Yale implements?  Should Stanford create institutions to create ties between graduate programs as is done at Harvard?  How can Stanford become a more serious academically focused student residential community like that at Princeton?
<p>
	All this lore we hear of or have experienced at East Coast schools has become tempting.  Should Stanford assimilate itself amongst the Ivy ranks?  Or do we prefer the laid back Ultimate Frisbee-playing and Palm Pilot-toting lifestyle that has become synonymous with Stanford—declared the "trendiest" school among American Universities.  That's a question the new university president will have to address.
<p>
	The Stanford University President takes on many roles.  He or she serves as the ceremonial head of the university, entertains and engages the student body (think Gaieties), manages the university, raises funds, provides general leadership, and serves as a spokesman for education on a worldwide level.
<p>
	The Presidential Selection Committee is seeking an individual who can fulfill all of these roles while acting on an awe-inspiring vision that will make Stanford a University that will not just strive to be compared to the "H-word" but will surpass it.
<p>
	Do you have input for the Presidential Selection Committee?  Send your opinions to Mike Levin, ASSU President, at president@assu.stanford.edu.

	On Tuesday, January 18, Stanford's Objectivist Club hosted a lecture on Ayn Rand's philosophy in an attempt to recruit new members.  While the lecture was packed and both members and attendees cared deeply about philosophy, the ensuing debate ended up alienating many of the potential recruits.
<p>
	Objectivism is the philosophy of the novelist Ayn Rand, author of the Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and a major inspiration for the modern libertarian movement.  The Objectivist movement, however, is more than a political position; it is an entire philosophical position.
<p>
	Explaining this position in overview was the task of Dr. Harry Binswanger in his videotape.  Taken at Harvard in 1997, it featured an hour's lecture to a mostly filled auditorium, followed by a two-hour question and answer session.
<p>
	That Tuesday night, Mr. Binswanger's image lectured to a small, packed room in Tresidder, intended to hold thirty but filled with forty-three.  Most were students, but a few older people dotted the audience.
<p>
	Only five of those attending were members of the Objectivist club.  Started by Mark Goldenson and Rick Gerkin in 1997 as a registered organization with the ASSU, the club had a lull last year as the founders turned to other things.  Now funded again by the ASSU, the club is revving up and trying to attract students. Attempting this year to revive it is Bradley Malestein, a blond, cheerful master's student in statistics.
<p>
	"This academic year," says Mr. Malestein, "I've got a few people who seem quite dedicated. [W]e're trying to do these events in order to get people interested, to let them know Objectivism is here.  That's our goal this year."
<p>
	The video lecture by Mr. Binswanger launched a sequence of three events.  On Tuesday, January 25, Gary Hull from the Ayn Rand Institute lectured, again by videotape, on "Your Professor's War Against the Mind: The Black Hole of Postmodernism and Multiculturalism."  The capstone of the sequence is Dr. Andrew Bernstein's live lecture on February 8, in building 260-113 at 7:00 p.m. over "The Mind as Hero in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged."
<p>
	As an undergraduate at Michigan, Mr. Malestein became President of the Objectivist Club, which had about a dozen members.
<p>
	"Meetings there had some people who were really knowledgeable about Objectivism – people who had gone through the Objectivism graduate center classes and spent a lot of time studying it," says Mr. Malestein.  "We'd get Virtue of Selfishness [a book of Objectivist essays], agree on an article, and read it.  Someone would come prepared with questions and we'd discuss it.  That might be something we will do in the future."
<p>
	Discussions of philosophy are appropriate especially to Objectivism – it's often possible to pick out Objectivists or former Objectivists by their tremendous interest in philosophy, in the first principles of ethics and life.  Mr. Binswanger's talk began with a question, "Who needs philosophy?" and an answer, "You do."
<p>
	Mr. Binswanger went on to describe the answers Ayn Rand provided to the most basic questions of philosophy.  Objectivism asserts that man is, by nature, a self-interested animal whose highest goal ought to be his own life and happiness.  He is required, therefore, to act rationally at all times, which includes respecting the rights of others by never initiating the use of physical force.
<p>
	Ayn Rand gained international fame in 1943 when she published her third novel, the Fountainhead, the story of a brilliant architect struggling to deal with a world hostile to his innovations.  Her masterpiece, Atlas Shrugged, became an international bestseller in 1957.  Both books proclaim by example that philosophy of rational self-interest, which she spent her later years developing into a full-fledged movement.
<p>
	Objectivism is similar politically to classical liberalism in its belief in individual rights and the benefits of rational self-interest.  But where classical liberalism evolved by a process of gradual discovery by such thinkers as Locke, Smith, and Hayek, Objectivism is the philosophy of Ayn Rand and Ayn Rand only.  Its development by her disciples consists mainly of articulating a position well-fortified and well-separated from the rest of philosophy.  Ayn Rand admired few philosophers other than Aristotle, and criticized many of the rest as contributing to irrationalism or skepticism.
<p>
	Some, like Alex Zane, a sophomore who attended the lecture and stayed until the very end, view that independence from traditional philosophy as a weakness.
<p>
	"I agree with a lot of the things they said, and I agreed with them before I was even exposed to [Objectivism]," says Mr. Zane, "but I think that a lot of the philosophers they denounced, like Kant or Hume, actually worked at establishing some of the things they value, like a system of ethics derived from reason."
<p>
	Mr. Binswanger's overview of Objectivism emphasized the absolute independence of man from others, that "in the end, one must face the world alone."  This rational individualism opposes not only collectivism, but also religion and environmentalism, the first for its irrationalism and the second for its radical proponents' elevation of Nature over the individual.  After the hour-long video, the Objectivist Club yielded to questions, as a chance for interested people to ask and learn more about Objectivism and the club. After all, recruiting was the whole point of the lecture.
<p>
	"There are people who are not sure about it – they want to find out more," says Mr. Malestein.  "There are people who are Objectivists but who just didn't hear about us. So we are trying to popularize [the club] through the tapes and the speaking events."
<p>
	But, far from simple clarifications for those who wanted to learn more, the questions attempted to find holes in Objectivism, to spark a debate – and succeeded in provoking a strong response from the Objectivist quarter.
<p>
	The first question came from an elderly gentleman questioning the absolute self-sufficiency of human beings and proposing instead the existence of a social contract.  Three of the five members of the Objectivist Club piled on in a tag-team Objectivist rebuttal, arguing with him loudly and at length before he could respond.
<p>
	The rest of the question and answer session continued in much the same fashion, quoting Ms. Rand and Leonard Peikoff, her designated heir, to answer questions inspired by Rousseau, Hume, and neoclassical economics.  At one point, an audience member told a particularly loud Objectivist who had been answering questions to be quiet and let the questioner speak.
<p>
	Such stridency and moral certainty characterized the early institutions of Objectivism as well.  While Ms. Rand's philosophy agrees in many ways with classical liberalism, she differed with it on the issue of tolerance, refusing to give sanction to those whose views she disagreed with.
<p>
	So long as she lived, Ms. Rand spurned the libertarian movement that she so greatly influenced, viewing it as lacking any sort of moral core.  Similarly, her relationships with free-market conservatives were more than strained, as an Objectivist's commitment to reason precludes any form of religious faith.  In fact, Ms. Rand seldom showed more contempt than when she dismissed religion.
<p>
	Did the club succeed in recruiting new members?  While it's too early to tell, the reactions of the students who stayed until the end were mixed at best.
<p>
	 "I feel like it's my moral duty to come every once in a while [to the Objectivist club presentations]," says Mark Johnson, a junior majoring in philosophy.  "I love Ayn Rand, and I think she's got a great philosophy for life that's very interesting. But they just avoid so many issues that are blatantly staring them in the face that they really need to address.  They just toss them off as axiomatic. I feel that, especially being as strong a proponent of Ayn Rand as I am, I should come."
<p>
	"[If] dogmatism means that, on blind faith, we just accept these ideas and we are going to espouse them come what may," says Mr. Malestein, "then obviously that's not my attitude.  I've looked at the facts and these are the conclusions I've come to, … so of course I'm going to defend them strongly – I'm not going to back down.  It's not just blind faith, that whatever Ayn Rand says is right …  you have to ask yourself all these questions."
<p>
	In the end, no one at Stanford should dislike a group dedicated to intellectual discussion, whatever it is that they discuss.  But, depending on the character and the width of that discussion, that group may limit their membership more than necessary.
<p>
	Says Mr. Zane, "I think that maybe they make too many enemies.  They need to find some allies - they're just trying to be too punk rock."
