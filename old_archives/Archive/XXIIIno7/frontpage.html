<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif"><i>We at the Review have long taken an active interest in the state of affairs at Stanford, and given this we felt it necessary to draw the board of trustees'  attention to three talented and remarkable individuals we strongly urge them to consider when determining the University's next president. We feel that all three demonstrate the qualities and experience that a 21st century university president must have in order to place their institution at the forefront of research and scholarly excellence.  Reprinted here are the profiles that we submitted to the Presidential Search Committee last week. <p>

<font size=+2>John Shoven</font><br>
<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/XXIIIno7/images/shoven.jpg" alternate="John Shoven" width=145 height=188 align=left>	John Shoven holds the Charles R. Schwab Professorship in the Stanford Economics Department.  Beginning his stay at Stanford in 1973, Dr. Shoven has served Stanford for more than 25 years as the Chairman of the Economics Department (1986-1989), Director of the Center for Economic Policy Research (1989-1993), and the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences (1993-1998).
</i></font>
<p>
	Dr. Shoven is an expert on tax policy and pension policy.  He was even a consultant for the U.S. Treasury Department from 1975 to 1988.  He has written 10 books and nearly 80 articles on his economic research.  In 1995, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
<p>
	Dr. Shoven majored in physics at UC San Diego and minored in economics, the field in which he obtained his Ph.D. from Harvard.  The minor was something that he has firmly believed in, and something that succeeded in reinstituting at Stanford.
<p>
	Some of his most recent papers include, "The Real Deal: The History and Future of Social Security," with Sylvester Schieder; "Should the United States Privatize Social Security," with Henry Aaron; "Long Run Asset Allocation for Retirement Savings," and "Public Policy Towards Pensions," with Sylvester Schieder.
<p>
	In the first few months of Casper's presidency, Shoven was selected as the new Humanities and Sciences Dean.  He helped take Stanford to the top of universities in the United States with his announcement of the Program in Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, an example of his interdisciplinary approach to the School of Humanities and Sciences.
<p>
	Dr. Shoven helped reconstruct the Cultures, Ideas, and Values (CIV) program, supported higher standards for language and writing requirements, and sponsored many of Stanford's freshman and sophomore seminars, one of which he personally taught as the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences.
<p>
	Shoven took responsibility for the program in Science, Technology, and Society, a program that, though the University nearly got rid of in 1996 due to lack of faculty support, is now a requirement for undergraduates.
<p>
	When he left his position as the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences, he thought that Stanford was in as good of a position as any other university in the country.  He was quoted as saying, "We're trying hard not to specialize--we're trying to be good at everything."
<p>

<font size=+2>Condoleezza Rice</font><br>
<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/XXIIIno7/images/rice.jpg" alternate="Condoleezza Rice" width=145 height=188 align=left>	Officially, she is on a one-year leave of absence from Stanford.  Unofficially, she could be the United State's next Secretary of State.  Condoleezza Rice, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute, was provost of Stanford for six years and also served as the chief academic and budget officer of the university.
<p>
	Today, she is one of George W. Bush's top foreign policy advisors and one of his California campaign co-chairs.
<p>
	Rice is no stranger to Washington, D.C.; she has been there to work on nuclear strategic planning at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was director of Soviet and East European affairs with the National Security Council, was appointed special assistant to the president for national security affairs and senior director for Soviet affairs at the National Security Council under George Bush.  She helped bring reforms to Poland and helped Bush in many of his policies with the Soviet Union.
<p>
	Her political experience is as impressive as her ability.  She enrolled at the University of Denver at the age of 15 and graduated cum laude at 19 with a bachelor's degree in political science.  She has a master's degree from Notre Dame and a doctorate from the University of Denver's Graduate School of International Studies--both in political science.  It is no surprise, then, that she has received tenure as a professor in Stanford's political science department.
<p>
	She co-founded the Center for a New Generation, an after-school academy in East Palo Alto.  She is a corporate board member for such corporations as Chevron, the Hewlett Foundation, and Charles Schwab.  She is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations, a trustee for the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
<p>
	In a column last year, Condoleezza Rice outlined three things that she thought Stanford students should do: work with and get to know faculty members, learn something in-depth and do something academic that students would never have thought possible, and get to know the other Stanford students.  As provost, Rice furthered these goals by working with President Casper, the faculty, and other administrators in improving the Freshman Seminars, Sophomore Seminars and Dialogues, Sophomore College, and creating the Freshman/Sophomore College.
<p>
	But what is good for the country may be bad for Stanford--Rice could end up as a cabinet member of the next President, and Stanford could be left without one of its most preeminent leaders.

<font size=+2>William Bennett</font><br>
<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/XXIIIno7/images/bennett.jpg" alternate="" width=150 height=206 align=left>	From the Reagan era comes a somewhat controversial man in William Bennett.  Born in Brooklyn, New York, Bennett has been involved in some of the most important offices in the nation.
<p>
	In his early career, he was at different times the executive director, president, and director of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina from 1976 to 1981.  He has also held the positions of president and chairman during his 4-year stint with the National Endowment for the Humanities.
<p>
	His most important--and controversial--jobs came while he was secretary of education under President Reagan from 1985-1989 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Bush from 1989-90.
<p>
	Dubbed the "drug czar," William Bennett had zero tolerance for drug dealers, and he believed that the war on drugs should be heightened rather than reformed.
<p>
	His moral authority was in the news during the impeachment of President Clinton, when he wrote The Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals, and was thought by many to be one of the Republican Party's leading social conservative.  In his argument, he wrote, "We need institutions that more accurately reflect the sentiments and beliefs of the great body of the American people rather than those of the cultural deconstructionists" and the "permanent political establishment in Washington."  He is not one to play political games.
<p>
	The Nation magazine placed him up with authors like Dinesh D'Souza, Francis Fukuyama, and Allan Bloom in the area of transforming our cultural and political ideas "on issues that are central to the way we organize ourselves as a society."
<p>
	During the House impeachment of Bill Clinton, he was also a guest commentator for ABC News.
<p>
	He received his BA from Williams College in 1965, his Ph.D. at the University of Texas in 1970, and his JD from Harvard University in 1971.
