Interview With Senator Michael Osofsky
</font><br>

<b>Two weeks ago, Stanford students voted into ASSU office a new group of senators and class presidents, and a new president and vice-president. Among the victors was Michael Osofsky '03. In his campaign for senate, Osofsky garnered 1386 votes, more than any senator in ASSU history. Considering his historic victory, <i>The Stanford Review</i> sat down with Osofsky to talk about student politics at Stanford and his plans for the future.</b><p>

<i>TSR: What is your reaction to your victory?</i><p>

The ASSU this year has been very broken apart. There has been hardly any unity. There's been no cohesion among the senate. There really hasn't been
much work done between the undergraduate senate, the graduate student council, and the president and vice-president. What I wanted to do was make a strong statement to the new senate and the new president and vice-president that we've got to get on the ball immediately and start working hard. I wasn't expecting that sort of response. So I'm humbled from that, but that only gives me drive.<p>

<i>TSR: During your campaign, you spoke a lot about Tresidder. What are your thoughts on Tresidder?</i><p>

Tresidder is not a student union. All the top admintrators will admit that Tresidder is a moneymaking endeavor and not a student union. Last year, we proposed to add arcade games and foosball tables. Now we have the permission to add foosball tables, so we'll probably be doing that in the next couple of weeks, as well as getting heat lamps outside the CoHo. We'll also be trying to get a pizza joint to replace the Corner Pocket. We're trying to work with the Office of Student Affairs to have a shuttle to San Francisco or a shuttle to movie theaters. We are one of the top academic institutions in the country. So our student union should be better than other student unions. It's time for the administration to realize that.<p>

<i>TSR: You focus on the daily life of Students. Last year the post office, and this year Tresidder. Other senators try to create more fundamental administrative changes, such as increasing diversity among tenured faculty. What do you see as the primary function of the ASSU senate?</i><p>

There is the student life side of change, and there is the student advocacy side, dealing with larger issues like diversity. What I've found is that it is extremely difficult to effect administrative change. Of course we should continue to voice our concerns to the administration, but what I think students on this campus are most frustrated with is hearing these lofty goals from the ASSU and never seeing them happen. What I've been trying to do this past year is make these things happen. For instance, the post office was receptive to change. It's important to increase the
quality of student life. It's important to increase the accountability of elected officials. I'm going to help institute a twice monthly newsletter, in conjunction with the graduate student council and the president and vice-president, to be distributed through the post office. (Concerning)  issues of accountability, (there will be) town hall meetings where students can talk with elected officials.<p>

<i>TSR: Do you think the board of trustees, the president, the provost, and other high level administrators are responsive to the Senate?</i><p>

I think the administration is willing to listen to the senate and listen to the students. The bureacracy of the school creates situations where change at any level is difficult. Doing a student night at the CoHo is not a walk in the park. The administration is going to throw up ten barriers before you can do something like that. For some more large-scale issue, it's nearly impossible for that to happen. It's important for the student government to serve as a vehicle for continuously voicing those concerns. For instance, if the senior class is upset with a commencent speaker, the senior class presidents should make sure that concern gets to the president (of the unversity).<p>

<i>TSR: To what factors do you attribute your electoral success?</i><p>

What I hope is that my electoral success was dictated by a couple of things. First, it had to do with how hard I campaigned. I put up about 2500 flyers to get my name out there. I'd go door to door. I'd hand out
flyers at flicks. I spent about 15-20 hours writing personal e-mails to spread the word. What I wanted to do was take campaigning away from just having a catchy slogan and focus on the issues. I think that students want to see what you're going to do and what you've done. I hope I received that quantity of votes as a result of students seeing that I'm dedicated to them.<p>

<i>TSR: Did this year's change in campaign restrictions change the way people campaigned?</i><p>

I think we saw no real change in campaigning at the senate level. At the president/vice-president level, campaigning changed dramatically. People spent a lot more money, without funding restrictions. I think the successful candidates were the candidates who went through the grassroots efforts and mobilized a campaign team and got theword out about what the real ideas were.<p>

<i>TSR: Do you think students take an active interest in ASSU politics?</i><p>

Some do. There is a sense of apathy. Some students don't like it  when campaign time comes around. But you do meet a lot of students, in campaigning and going door to door, who are interested in what you stand for. I think a lot of the apathy that exists can be changed. Ultimately, one of the reasons I enjoy being a part of the ASSU is to create some systematic change to make students respect student government. For me, (being a senator) is about doing things that improve the quality of life for students on this campus.<p>

<i>TSR: What's your long term vision for the ASSU?</i><p>

Hopefully, there will be a new student union. Hopefully, there will be a mutual respect between the administration and the student government, where students will have the ability to dictate what happens on this university. A lot of issues are going to have to be resolved. For instance, there is a parking crunch. There are too many students for the amount of housing that we have. There are transportation issues. In my time, over the next two years, what I hope for is at least a dozen substantive changes that are actually visible. Improving the undergraduate academic advising program. Extending the hours of Green library to 24 hours a day. Doing things at Tresidder. Or Simply making it so that driving around on a bike on Mayfield in front of FloMo is safer.<p>

<i>TSR: How does the ASSU work with other organizations on campus, such as SIG or the women's center?</i><p>

The ASSU works well with student groups, particular minority, ethnic, and cultural groups. For instance the president (Matt Brewer '03) has been a big player in the black student council. Working with the Stanford Republicans, the Democrats, and SIG is something the ASSU has done particularly well. At the beginning of this year, I was part of the Stanford voter registration project. I try to listen to each individual concern and each individual issue, and simultaneously act as a leader in bringing the senate together. I try to give as much as time as possible to the ASSU.<p>

<i>TSR: How would you describe student political life on campus?</i><p>

At a political level, some people take things more seriously than others, and it is very obvious. There can be phoniness, there can be arbitrariness. You can make a lot of friends, you can lose a lot of friends. When you put aside the politics, especially in an organization like the ASSU, when you be a genuine person, and go and talk to students, and voice concerns, you can get around political games. As a campus, there are some divisions. There is a great deal of apathy toward national politics and student politics. A lot of it is because the change students want to see isn't going to happen. Some people are disillusioned with student government, and I'm trying to change that.<p>


<i>Mr. Osofsky hopes to continue to play an active role in ASSU politics for the next two years.</i><p>
