	How can a nation founded on liberty embrace a socialist monopoly on education that strips parents of control over their children's upbringing?  Here is a clue: almost no one recognizes that our socialist monopoly on education is a socialist monopoly, even though the fact is incontrovertible.<p>

	Monopoly power is defined by barriers to entry.  Outside of an absolute legal barrier to entry (as with patent rights or the United States Postal Service’s chartered monopoly), the fact that people who want to send their children to private schools have to pay twice (still paying the public school tuition via taxation) constitutes a higher barrier to entry than can be found anywhere in the sphere of private economic relations.<p>

	This extreme price advantage for government schools effectively coerces many people into sending their children to government schools who would rather their children receive a different kind of education than the collectivity imposes, decimating the private education market.  Microsoft is a flea in comparison.  Forcing people to pay twice if they want to send their children to private schools constitutes a coercive anti-competitive behavior that would certainly be illegal under the principles, if not the letter, of current anti-trust law.<p>

	The problem is that, with the education monopoly under local control, parents typically end up with large investments in their public schools, first by choosing to live in the best school district they can afford, then by participating in local politics and otherwise directly trying to contribute to the functioning of their school systems.  This investment
creates an alliance with the public schools such that any alternative, if it seems to pose a threat to the public schools, is seen as an enemy. All criticisms of the socialist monopoly itself (instead of debate about how to make it work) are resisted, including the description of public schools as a socialist monopoly.<p>

	This is just the phenomenon of biased or dishonest reason, proposed in my last article as the meaning of original sin.   In a social environment, interpretations of reality have manipulative power. Our original inclination is to use that power, seeking those interpretations that seem to strengthen the hand of what we take to be our interest (either our self-interest or our interest in the world around).<p>

	The price is that we lose touch with reality.  We can follow reason and evidence or we can frame our interpretations to the advantage of what we think is in our interest, but we can't do both.  Following biased reason blinds us to where our interests really lie.  This is very much the case with public schools, where just acknowledging the fact of socialist
monopoly should be a stopper.<p>

	It is bizarre enough to hand one's own children over to the government for half of their upbringing.  It is quite another to force other people to turn their children over to the government.  That it is local government does not alter the fact that individual parents are stripped of choice about how their children should be raised.  The least one can do is not be prejudiced in favor of an arrangement that, on its face, would seem to constitute the most blatant evil.<p>

	In a spirit of honest inquiry (if that is possible for public school advocates) let's see if any of the common justifications for the public monopoly can put any weight in the scale against what everyone should acknowledge to be the very great value of liberty.<p>

	Almost universally agreed upon is the public interest in seeing to it that all children have the opportunity to receive an education, whether
their parents can afford private education for them or not.  But it is possible to support education for the needy without creating a public monopoly.  A voucher system would do it.  So would charging full cost tuition at public schools (to eliminate the artificial price advantage of public schools) and then offering need-based assistance.<p>

	As for affording all students a quality education, socialist monopoly is the great enemy of quality while choice, and the competition it generates, is the great engine of quality.  This is obviously true with educational methods, where whatever works best, or works best for particular children, will expand accordingly in private market share.<p>

	For instance, tremendous teaching success has been found with methods of "directed learning," particularly for boys, who thrive on immediate challenge and competition.  Yet directed learning was for a long time shunned by the public schools in favor of non-judgmental, self-esteem based techniques such as no-right-answer math and "whole language" reading instruction (word guessing and anything-goes spelling).<p>

	The same thing holds for values and environment.  Kids who are targets for teasing or harassment find little protection in schools whose legal requirement to take all comers often makes discipline impossible and whose monopoly position makes responsiveness to the needs of individuals optional.  Parents who desperately want to keep their children from gang culture are routinely forced by the public school monopoly to send their children to schools where disruption is a leading activity and those who try to learn are treated as race traitors.  Under parental choice such schools would simply cease to exist.  Everyone would get a decent education, including the problem kids, as schools that were capable of
dealing with them would expand accordingly.<p>

	Enforcement of parents' obligations to educate their children would require some oversight, but this also provides no rationale for socialization, since oversight can be handled by testing.  If a particular school has a track record of producing students who can read and write and do math and who know history and science at however high a level is deemed necessary, then parental obligations are satisfied.  In such a system, it will be the public schools that exert downward pressure on standards.  Private schools, competing on the basis of success, will leave the state sector in the dust.<p>

	Altogether, the goal of a quality education for all is far better served by systems of liberty.  What about the possibility that public schools are needed to promote democratic culture?  By bringing children from all of society's diverse racial, ethnic and social backgrounds together for the critical years of their upbringing, public schools may establish
commonality.   Certainly republics have fragmented and spun apart for such reasons so this would not be an idle concern, but public schools are on the wrong side of the ledger here too.  They do not promote democratic culture but undermine it, in spectacular fashion.<p>

	On the question of race, there is no doubt that socialized education is largely responsible for the segregation of America into black inner city slums and white suburbs.  When individual choice is denied, the remnant of control that people retain is through the mechanisms of collective choice.  That requires moving to be with like-minded people who have similar priorities, values and competencies.  To the extent that differences in these characteristics, and differences in the ability to move, fall along racial or ethnic lines, reliance on collective choice tends to create segregation, not lessen it.<p>

	Private schools in contrast are free to target whatever ethnic diversity they want, and since almost all practice affirmative action to some degree, it seems clear that individual choice tends to favor integration.  Research by James Coleman in the 60's showed that
substantial "white flight" was motivated by resistance to school integration, but that was in the public schools, which have little capacity to maintain discipline or standards.  Private schools have proven that they will take all comers who aspire to their ethos.  If it weren't for socialized education we would probably today have integrated cities, integrated schools,  and several entire generations of well-educated blacks.  Given a choice, what black parents wouldn't send their children to schools that worked?<p>

	In general, centrifugal forces are much more prominent in the political sphere, where public schools are controlled, than in private decision-making.  It is race-oriented politicians who want to impose identity politics on other people's children.  Spanish speaking Californians had to overcome the politically motivated bilingual education lobby in order to have their children taught in English.  In contrast to politicians, parents mostly want the same things for their children.  This compatibility amongst private values is what creates the melting pot, while the ambition of politicians is what threatens to destroy it.<p>

	In sum, socialist monopoly serves its proposed justifications far  worse than liberty does.  Neither is there anything the least bit ambiguous about any of these cases. Thus we can determine that those who embrace these justifications are not coming to different conclusions, they are instead starting with conclusions, manifesting original sin. The proof is in the pudding.  What do reason and evidence say?  If public school advocates embrace conclusions that reason and evidence reject every step of the way, then they can't be following reason and evidence.<p>

	I believe we have a duty to forgive original sin, but also to fight it, to expose it, to condemn it.  Moral progress requires, first of all, thinking forwards, from reason and evidence to conclusions, not backwards, from conclusions to any available redoubt for defending them.  When thinking backwards is used to lock in place a system of mis-education of the young, we are in danger of institutionalizing the predominance of original sin, insuring that a majority of the next generation will not think straight.  When the mechanism of mis-education is a government monopoly the result is not just an illiberalism, but a neutron bomb of illiberalism, capable of annihilating liberty in all directions while leaving improper government power unscathed and ascendant.<p>
