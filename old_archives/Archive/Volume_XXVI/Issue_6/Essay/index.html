A liberal society embraces the priority of liberty. It acknowledges that voluntary arrangements are inherently superior to force, both morally and practically, implying that government (as one embodiment of force) should only restrict liberty (the prerequisite to voluntary agreement) for reasons important enough to outweigh the very great value of liberty. In the case of our nation's socialist monopoly on education, the proposed justifications for public monopoly--to insure quality educational opportunities for all, to promote integration and common bonds--are far better served by systems of parental choice. (See <a href="../../Issue_5/Essay/index.html" onMouseOver="window.status='Education and Original Sin'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '; return true">"Education and Original Sin," 5/16/01</a>). Thus at best the socialist monopoly is an inadvertent illiberalism. Those who support it could perhaps be imagining that the value of liberty has been outweighed, when actually it has been augmented. There is, however, another possibility: that the proponents of public monopoly value liberty itself negatively, so much so that they are willing to bear all the negative educational consequences for their own and other people's children in order to strip their neighbors of control over their children's upbringing. Groups like People for the American Way are perfectly explicit about this. The great enemy in their eyes is the threat that religion, and religious education, poses to the dominance of secular society.<p>

	To wage their war on religion, People for the American Way at the same time insists on the socialist monopoly on education and demands that all religion be systematically extirpated from it. They try to leverage the concern that all children be afforded an education into a requirement for socialization by claiming that subsidization of parental choice (as
by a voucher system) allows parents to use public money to educate their children according to their own beliefs, violating the separation of church and state. This argument is utterly fallacious. Supporting parental choice is the opposite of state establishment of religion. What violates the First Amendment's establishment clause is for government to take over a crucial sphere of private endeavor-the education of children-and then impose on it a particular religious view: the extirpation of all religious content. This issue is right now working its way up to the Supreme Court where we will get a chance to see if the illiberalism of the Warren Court era still holds sway. In any case,  to value liberty itself negatively is what might be called a pure illiberalism. Ultimately any pure illiberalism is necessarily wrong, but this is not always obvious at first. Our nation was founded on the understanding that liberty works, but this is a subtle and hard won understanding, rare in human history. On the surface it can be counter-intuitive.<p>

The history of the last millennium is largely a history of religious war. Europe especially was devastated by religious conflict until it learned to take a step back from belief and towards Cartesian doubt and tolerance. In France today, a predominantly Catholic country, the whole nation accepts that the reason for imposing a socialist monopoly on education is to insure that most children will receive a secular education, keeping the role of religion in society modest, so that it cannot become a dangerous source of division. But unreasonableness is not the particular province of religion. The history of the last century is of sweeping crimes committed by socialist regimes that were or are either non-religious or anti-religious. The problem is illiberal government, whatever its ideological motivation. Trying to protect against illiberal government by giving government an illiberal monopoly on education is backwards on its face. This doesn't mean their aren't limits on how parents should be free to raise their children. No parent should be allowed to intentionally stunt their children's faculties so that they can be indoctrinated into accepting what competence would reject. One would be hard pressed to find any parents who actually try to stunt their children in this way, but the teaching of things like creationism and afro-centrism do raise the issue. This concern can be fully dealt with under the legitimate state role of providing minimum necessary oversight to education, insuring that parents' fulfill their basic obligations to raise their children to a competence of their faculties. This role calls for the subsidizing of education (ideally, billed to the parents' account) when parents cannot
pay for their children's education themselves, and it calls for a system of testing to insure that minimum educational standards (set at however high a level is deemed to satisfy parental obligations) are met. There is no need to require that the teaching of any doctrine be prohibited, only that  basic subjects be taught. Being exposed to particular views about what makes sense in no way limits a person's competence to decide for himself what makes sense, so long as he is raised to a competence of his faculties. Are the students of a particular private school learning their math and science? Are they literate? Do they understand the theory of evolution? If so, it does no harm for them to be given an alternative to the theory of evolution to ponder. Religious schools have the highest standards of educational achievement in the nation. When comparisons are controlled for socio-economic background, religious schools make the public schools look positively sick (which they often are). As all the legitimate concerns are seen to favor liberty, we are brought back again to the pure illiberalism of the public monopoly on education: the positive value that many people put on stripping everyone else of control over their own children's upbringing. To see what a mistake this is, it is necessary to understand how and why liberty works. When people are free to pursue their own discoveries of value they make progress in the discovery and pursuit of value. They see what there is to value in each other and the world around. Liberty then supports this morality materially. Economic liberty (capitalism)
encourages cooperation by rewarding people in accordance with (to a first approximation) the value they deliver to others. A little crime control to deal with those who can't figure it out and, voil‡. What creates a moral community is the dissemination and cooperation that thrive under liberty.  The liberty of parents to pass on to their children what they have found to be most important is a crucial part of this process. When the state strips parents of choice over their children's education it insures that, when it comes to sophisticated understanding that requires education, parental discoveries of right and sense will largely NOT be passed on, debilitating moral and material progress. Shouldn't you be able to choose to send your children to a school that will teach them about the centuries long struggle to secure the blessings of liberty? Such a school might, at the appropriate time, teach economics and the more rigorous comprehension of the instrumentalities of liberty. It might make sure that all students understand our Constitution's structure of limited enumerated powers, now violated in every imaginable way. Why should you have to send your children to schools where McCarthyism is taught as if the great stain on our nation's history is not the large membership in a secret society that strove to destroy American liberty, but the marginally excessive means used to try to expose it? Stalin murdered 20 million, and our public schools teach that the real tragedy is that a handful of his traitorous supporters lost their jobs. It is no coincidence that such an illiberal institution as socialized education has become illiberal in its content as well. The forces of illiberalism created it, and continue to create it every day. Just as illiberal government has bought its way outward with middle class entitlements--socializing retirement to buy old people, using price supports to buy farmers, offering day care subsidies to buy working parents, etcetera ad nauseam--so too it has bought its way outwards by offering "free" public education. For parents who simply care about their children's education and don't put a positive value on limiting parental choice, letting parents take their education dollars elsewhere (as by a voucher system) is a win-win alternative. Quality public schools will be able to compete successfully and draw from a wider pool. As private alternatives grow, bad public schools will lose students or be taken over. When public schools do lose students it will be because parents have found better choices elsewhere. All schools, public and private, will be improved by competition. What impedes these people from voting for their own interests is what I have been calling "original sin": the tendency of people to think backwards, starting with their presumptions about what is right or in their interest and grasping at any rationalization that seems to support their presumed interests. Assigning one's faculties of intelligence to this defensive task leaves one oblivious to reality and to where one's interests really lie.  (See "On Original Sin," 5/9/01.) This mechanism is brought into play because the public monopoly has forced parents to invest heavily in the public schools, first by choosing what school district to buy a house in, then by working through local politics, and direct participation in the schools, to try to get their children's schools to work. This investment creates identification with the public schools such that anything that threatens the public schools--any alternative--is seen as an enemy to defend against. But actual interests can be determined. Every rationalization can be gone through and be seen to actually weigh on the side of liberty. This leaves only negative valuations of liberty itself to deal with, almost certainly a minority position. Hence the public monopoly could be broken if we could just get those who are not actual enemies of liberty to think front wards instead of backwards. Then there are to whom stripping parents of control of their children's upbringing is the goal: the pure illiberals. This too is a product of original sin, just at a much deeper level. The embrace of dishonest reason is, by its nature, always oriented towards the manipulation of power. Accordingly, it is drawn to power, making it instinctively paternalistic, always seeing right in government. To people who have followed this path, liberty is seen as corrupt, a "right wing" ideology. Maybe some of these people can be reached, but don't count on it. We will never be rid of original sin. All we can hope for is to beat it.<p>
