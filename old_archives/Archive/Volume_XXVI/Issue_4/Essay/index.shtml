On Original Sin
</font><br>

Adam ate from the Tree of Knowledge and incurred original sin, yet in moral theory, knowledge is positively valued. Achieving the most value one can with one's life requires making progress in discovering what there is to value and how to pursue it. Knowledge--that an apple can be tasty and nutritious--is an essential good. How could it give rise to
original sin?<p>

	An answer can be found in the life of Jesus, who in Christian theology was sent by God to shepherd mankind past original sin, not just by his death, but by his life. Consider the words of Jesus to Pilate, according to John: "I have come into the world to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice." "What truth?" Pilate replied, but Jesus did not answer.<p>

	Pilate was looking for a version of truth, demonstrating that he did not hear. Truth is not just one amongst many possible accounts of reality. It is a very special one, the fruit of a method, based on intellectual honesty. What do you honestly have grounds to assert? That is truth.<p>

<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXVI/Issue_4/Essay/images/adam_eve.jpg" width=154 height=203 alt="Adam & Eve" align=left>

	If we were solitary creatures then truth would be our original orientation. A mind's eye that accurately perceives the world around would convey the same advantages as an eye that accurately focuses light, revealing the dangers and opportunities we face. Only truth would have value.<p>

	But we are social animals, interacting with each other through our understandings of the world. Thus our interpretations of the world, by affecting the social world, affect our opportunities. No longer is truth all that matters. Interpretations of reality become an instrument of manipulation. Add Eve to Adam and we "knowing" animals, free to deploy our intellectual powers however we will, are no longer innocent.<p>

	Our original inclination is to use the powers at our command. Thus in situations of conflict or competition, where the mind is focused on how
to achieve advantage, our original inclination is to seek those interpretations that seem to strengthen the hand of what we take to be our interest (either our self-interest or our interest in the world
around). The price is that we lose touch with reality.<p>

	One can interpret the world by following truth--attending to what one can and cannot say on the basis of honest reason and evidence--or one can try to make the best case for advantageous conclusions, but not both. So long as one is "cutting the sleeve to fit the arm," as Bernard Shaw liked to say, starting with conclusions and using reason to come up with the most effective support for them, then one is not looking at reality. As a result, the ends and means that one cuts the sleeve to favor are liable to prove worthless or perverse. It is like driving down the road with your eyes closed, imagining you know where you are going, then wondering "what was that thump?" Maybe it was your life.<p>

	The great underlying truth is that people have a tremendous commonality of interests. Husbands, wives, neighbors, strangers, all for the most part participate in cooperative enterprises that make people's lives valuable to each other. In addition, our open ended faculties of intelligence cannot help but see what there is to like and appreciate about each other, looking outward together to what is worth doing in the world.<p>

	Interpreting reality for advantage threatens these common opportunities by  blinding us to where they really lie, making for a concept of original sin that squares with moral science. To effectively pursue value we must adhere to truth as a principle. Truth is a self-reinforcing principle because the truth is that only the truth matters. But learning to trust in truth is nevertheless an accomplishment, an imposition of structure. Untutored human intelligence--knowledge in its original state--lacks this structure, causing it to lose track of reality and incur any amount of unaccounted harm in pursuit of merely imagined value.<p>

	If anyone prefers not to invoke Christian religious concepts, or is not ready to embrace this interpretation of original sin, just call it biased reason, as I usually do. The point is, it is a pervasive moral failing (again, fitting nicely with the concept of original sin).<p>

	Biased reason in pursuit of merely imagined value is responsible for most of our societies failures of governance, for instance. Consider such failures of reason as the fact that half of  the country actually imagine that, when attacked by criminals, the rational course is to disarm. Or how does it happen that an entire nation, founded on liberty, has some how embraced a socialist monopoly on education? In future articles I will evidence my claim that these and other glaring phenomena are indeed manifestations of original sin.<p>

	For now, we  can find many examples right here in academia. Whole academic departments have embraced some form of moral relativism, premised on the idea that one person's interpretation of reality is as valid as any other's . Either no distinction is made between looking for advantageous interpretations and following honest reason or else it is claimed that there is no such thing as truth, that there is only interest, an "everybody does it" justification for the embrace of original sin.<p>

	The entire corpus of identity politics is pervaded by biased reason, looking for ways to claim victimization. The feminists, those daughters of Eve who claim to speak for their sex, go even further. Not only are their vast propaganda and advocacy statistics industries completely results oriented, but feminists also make themselves engines of original sin through their sexual behavior, holding out the apple to Adam and saying: "If you want me, you must swallow this."<p>

	What about women in general? The role of woman in the Garden of Eden--that of temptress--goes to the heart of the proposed concept of original sin: manipulation. Is there a basis for associating women more closely with manipulation, and hence original sin, than men? Yes.<p>

	There is no doubt that, throughout human evolution, women for the most part occupied positions of relative dependency, not wielding power directly but having to appeal to male power to secure their position. Skill in making manipulative claims should thus be an especially strong female orientation. In the political sphere this would make women the natural constituency of patriarchal government, geared to appeal to power to improve their lot.<p>

	But marginally different original tendencies are probably not very important. Original sin is universal, an unavoidable product of protean faculties that one must learn how to use. All are prone to interpret reality manipulatively and all can learn to overcome this original inclination.<p>

	Indeed, because trust in truth is self-reinforcing, original inclination should matter less than what road one gets on. Given that girls tend to be the more obedient students it might well be easier to
put them on the right road, if only socialized education--the ultimate illiberalism--weren't so busy putting all  of our students on the wrong road.<p>

	The real implication of untutored woman's proximity to the proposed concept of original sin is what it clarifies about original sin itself: that it's nature is to appeal to power. Thus in politics the original sinners will for the most part be the ones who favor paternalistic government. That is, we should expect a strong connection between distrust of truth and illiberalism, and this is borne out.<p>

	Just on the surface, notice that current advocates of paternalistic government generally call themselves liberal, without even a hint of irony. This is the product of a whole culture whose interpretations are based, not on making sense, but on advantage to what is presumed to be right, creating a systematic separation from reality. Peel pack the layers and very little of what this culture thinks is right actually is.<p>
