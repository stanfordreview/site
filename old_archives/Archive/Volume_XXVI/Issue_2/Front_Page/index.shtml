	First In A Two Part Series. David Horowitz and his staff has offered the anti-reparations ad to over twenty colleges nation wide. At some of those collges, there have been violent reactions. At Brown, strudents stole copies of the newspaper from newsstands. At Wisconsin, students demanded that the editor step down.<p>

	Horowitz offered the ad to the <i>Stanford Daily</i>, but the <i>Daily</i> rejected it.  Read this week about Horowitz's arguments, and read next week about how the <i>Daily</i> has handled the situation.<p>

	David Horowitz's recent ad campaign against reparations to African-Americans for slavery has incited controversy on college campuses across the country as much because of the way the message is justified as because of the message itself.  It's understandable that the liberal majority of college students, trained for years by the educational establishment to wave the banner of political-correctness, should resent such an affront, but the magnitude of the outrage is difficult to attribute to the message's conservative theme alone.  After all, today's college students are far less politically-conscious and far more materially-focused than were their parents in the Sixties, as a glance through the dot-com and I-Banking preponderance at any Stanford career fair will suggest.  Rather, there are inaccuracies and racist assumptions in Mr. Horowitz's arguments themselves that should give Americans of all political stripes pause.  Here we review each of Mr. Horowitz's ten points against reparations to discern exactly where the conservatism ends and Mr. Horowitz begins in the hope of saving the message from the messenger . . . .<p>

<b>1. There Is No Single Group Clearly Responsible For The Crime Of Slavery</b><br>
	Mr. Horowitz notes that there were about three thousand black slaveholders and asks, "Are reparations to be paid by their descendants too?"  This number is a statistical irrelevance when considered against the 1860 census figure of 4.4 million blacks, and dodges the larger question of the responsibility of the southern white ruling class for instituting and maintaining the slave system for over two centuries.<p>

<b>2. There Is No One Group That Benefited Exclusively From Its Fruit</b><br>
	Mr. Horowitz says, "If slave labor created wealth for Americans, then obviously it has created wealth for black Americans as well, including the descendants of slaves."  Setting aside Mr. Horowitz's narrow focus on wealth vis-a-vis the other things that matter in life, his economics is flawed.  Black slaves created wealth exclusively for their slave owners, and insofar as the fruits of the slave system "trickled down" to their descendants, they had a retarding effect on the economic growth of the South as a region until the rise of the Sun Belt after World War II.<p>

<b>3. Only A Tiny Minority Of White Americans Ever Owned Slaves, And Others Gave Their Lives To Free Them</b><br>
	This is true, but consider the sin of omission: the vast majority of white Americans who did not own slaves didn't do anything about it.<p>

<b>4. America Today Is A Multi-Ethnic Nation and Most Americans Have No Connection (Direct Or Indirect) To Slavery</b><br>
	This is true and it reinforces Mr. Horowitz's strongest argument (and the only leg he needs to stand on): all Americans deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law, irrespective of any factor that makes them different in the eyes of the world, including their heritage.<p>

<b>5. The Historical Precedents Used To Justify The Reparations Claim Do Not Apply, And The Claim Itself Is Based On Race Not Injury</b><br>
	Mr. Horowitz describes reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and to victims of racist violence in our own country and notes, "In each case, the recipients of reparations were the direct victims of the injustice or their immediate families." This is as it should be.  Aristotelian equality under the law means both giving due to those whom it is due and withholding due from those to whom it is undue, namely, those who have not been directly damaged themselves.<p>

<b>6. The Reparations Argument Is Based On The Unfounded Claim That All African-American Descendants of Slaves Suffer From The Economic Consequences Of Slavery And Discrimination</b><br>

	Here, Mr. Horowitz gets into his deepest trouble with both misleading statistics and simple racial bias.<p>

  Mr. Horowitz claims, "No evidence-based attempt has been made to prove that living individuals have been adversely affected by a slave system that was ended over 150 years ago," but the numbers tell a different story: The 1999 Census reports that while the median per-capita income of whites was $22,375, that of blacks was only $14,397.  Of course, any rigorous statistical "evidence-based attempt" to analyze the underlying causes requires looking at the variables beneath the numbers, so Mr. Horowitz proceeds to test hypotheses.  So far, so good, except that he can think of only one: "failures of individual character."  Does Mr. Horowitz really mean to say that blacks are inherently inferior to whites, or does he just forget the more probable explanation of centuries of implicit and institutional discrimination?  Yes.  It's tempting to conclude that Mr. Horowitz is both a racist and a bad statistician.<p>


<b>7. The Reparations Claim Is One More Attempt To Turn African-Americans Into Victims. It Sends A Damaging Message To The African-American Community.</b><br>

	Mr. Horowitz essentially makes a slippery-slope argument: special treatment for blacks will create a general culture of victimhood and encourage other disadvantaged groups to try the same thing.  Insofar as this argument is motivated by the same disregard for other races that Mr. Horowitz displays for African-Americans, it has no merit, but from the perspective of legal precedent it makes sense--Americans can never be reminded enough of our commitment to equality under the law.  Mr. Horowitz's cold and almost derisive treatment of the economic situation of blacks is worrying, however: he claims special treatment appears "necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others--many less privileged than themselves."<p>


<b>8. Reparations To African Americans Have Already Been Paid</b><br>

	Mr. Horowitz claims, "Since the passage of the Civil Rights Acts and the advent of the Great Society in 1965, trillions of dollars in transfer payments have been made to African-Americans in the form of welfare benefits and racial preferences (in contracts, job placements and educational admissions)."  Mr. Horowitz's figure of "trillions of dollars" seems suspect; he is unable to pinpoint it more specifically because his assertions of racial preferences in the marketplace are impossible to quantify.  The numbers that we do have--blacks' relative position to whites in income, educational admissions, prison populations, or any other measure of social well-being--point to significant differences which have not been redressed.<p>


<b>9. What About The Debt Blacks Owe To America</b><br>
	Mr. Horowitz attempts to make a point to those who highlight the black community by reversing the racial emphasis and focusing on what whites have accomplished, but he would have done better to lead by example and avoid segmenting racial groups in the first place.  That way, he could have avoided language that, separated from its context of turning the tables on black separatism, sounds like a pure Klan catechism: "There never was an anti-slavery movement until white Christians--Englishmen and Americans--created one."<p>


<b>10. The Reparations Claim Is A Separatist Idea That Sets African-Americans Against The Nation That Gave Them Freedom</b><br>

	If  Mr. Horowitz would have stuck to the beginning of his claim--reparations is a separatist idea--he would have been well-grounded in the American principle of e pluribus unum.  He attempts to go beyond and convince blacks to be grateful that their heritage is rooted in the system of slavery, however.  His claim that "America's African-American citizens are the richest and most privileged black people alive--a bounty that is a direct result of the heritage that is under assault" is a veiled reference to blacks' forced transportation from poor Africa to prosperous America, a crime that Mr. Horowitz should not presume the black community today will pardon on the basis of their pocketbooks.<p>


	The core of the anti-reparations argument makes sense: the American principle of equality under the law affords none of its citizens special privilege, and separatist politics only hinder real racial reconciliation.  It's the extra things Mr. Horowitz adds that get him  into trouble.  The real lesson of Mr. Horowitz for conservative college students around the country is that being conservative is enough: we need to draw the line at misrepresentation of facts and racism.<p>
