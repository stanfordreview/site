Across the political capitals of Europe, a new political movement has come into vogue: the Third Way.  Britain's Tony Blair, Germany's Gerhard Schroder, and France's Lionel Jospin preach a form of "pragmatic" liberalism -- denying pie-in-the-sky socialist pipe dreams while embracing a form of incentive-based, albeit regulated capitalism.  Third Way politicians seek the best of both worlds, in that they strive to tow the line between traditional conservative (i.e. big business) and liberal (i.e. labor unions) political interests.  Third Way presidents are nothing new to <A HREF=http://www.stanford.edu/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the web site of Stanford University!','Stanford University'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>Stanford</a>, though; we've had a European at the helm charting exactly such a course for nearly eight years now.
<p>

In announcing his pending retirement last month, Gerhard Casper signaled the end of an era.  It is an era that began at a low point in the history of our school.  Donald Kennedy, Casper's flashy predecessor, left in the wake of the Indirect Cost scandal.  The University was running considerable operating deficits.  Its infrastructure lay in ruins following the Loma Prieta earthquake.  And the advent of "multiculturalism" left the curriculum in an even worse shambles than Stanford's buildings.<p>

The Board of Trustees saw in Mr. Casper just what Stanford Needed.  A man of unquestionable personal integrity, this staid academic vowed to depoliticize the presidency and right Stanford's course, focusing on the twin pillars of research and undergraduate education.  And to this end, he's had quite a bit of success.  President Casper leaves office next spring having presided over the reform of the General Education Requirements, the creation of Introduction to the Humanitites, and the return of the minor.  He also trimmed bloated budgets while rebuilding our toppled buildings.<p>

But even the most enthusiastic Casper supporters must likewise admit his stint in Building 10 hasn't been beyond criticism.  Mr. Casper backed the financially disastrous UCSF hospital merger.  He capitulated to radical special interest groups when he bowed to hunger-striking students and created the politicized ethnic studies programs.  He centralized the control of information by placing the previously independent University News Services and Stanford Alumni Association under the administration's control.  And--most striking of all--he stubbornly stood by Stanford's excessive speech code, even as a lawsuit co-filed by <i>Review</i> editors sounded its death-knell.<p>

And yet, to whatever extent President Casper's charge was to usher in an era of respite and tranquility, he's done so.  The Farm is the most quite it's been in a generation.  The anti-war turmoil of the '70s and "multicultural" marches of the '80s are distant memories, nightmares from another age.  <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> categorized Casper's tenure as a "reign of calm," and <i>The San Francisco Examiner</i> implied that his steady hand repaired Stanford's damages reputation.<p>

In this sense, Mr. Casper forged his own "third day" between the activist course of his liberal predecessor and the reformist route championed by conservatives.  Mr. Casper has won his peace.  But, we are forced to ask, to what end?  What intrinsic value do peace and prosperity have, if not used as a springboard for progress?  The challenge now posed to Mr. Casper in the waning months of his presidency is to cash in a peace dividend from the serenity he's so arduously pursued.  We've long since abandoned our pleas that Mr. Casper join us in the reformist camp.  Rather, we suggest he pursue an appropriately moderate--albeit substantive--agenda befitting a retiring president.  Our proposed agenda has a threefold focus: admissions, tuition, and academic reform.<p>

For <A HREF=http://www.stanford.edu/home/admission/index.html onMouseOver="drc('Visit the Stanford University Admissions Home Page!','Stanford University Admissions'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>admissions</a>, we don't vainly encourage Mr. Casper to uproot racial preferences in the selection process (he won't as he made clear in his oft-self invoked "definitive" defense of affirmative action in 1995), but rather to focus on a less-publicized practice that equally taints the admissions process.  Stanford doles out extra financial aid grants to targeted ethnic groups in the hope of meeting its yearly racial quotas.  In short, financial aid affirmative action uses student grant money to achieve the admission office's political ends.  Mr. Casper, by bravely invoking an honest dialogue on this veiled subject, could go a long way in ending these political games played with students' pocketbooks.<p>

Tuition reform might prove a little more difficult, but where there's presidential will there's a way.  We challenge President Casper to hold the line on tuition this year--to announce no nominal increase in tuition for the 2000-2001 academic year.  After years of tuition hikes exceeding inflation by 2-5% annually, this might be both the most compassionate and forward-thinking action Mr. Casper can take, one which will no doubt earn him plaudits from both our student body and alumni.<p>

Finally, we exhort Mr. Casper to show his support for the embattled humanities and social sciences, ravaged after years of "multicultural" relativism.  Mr. Casper, himself a constitutional scholar, is no doubt mindful of the importance of individual rights and the Western political tradition that gave root to the US Constitution.  In this light, we encourage him to use discretionary funds to establish the Casper Constitutional Scholarship, a program that would provide research grants to students studying the societal and cultural importance of constitution-protected freedom.<p>

Beginning a frank, public discussion of financial aid affirmative action.  Halting tuition hikes for one year.  Establishing the Caper Constitutional Scholarship program.  This is our proposed agenda for our Third Way president--a "fourth way" for our outgoing chief.  Should Mr. Casper pass it up and focus only on preserving campus serenity, he risks forfeiting the peace dividend that could be his lasting legacy.<p>
