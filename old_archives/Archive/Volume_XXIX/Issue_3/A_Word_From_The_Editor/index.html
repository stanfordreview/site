We lightened up my picture a little bit, so that I'll look less like the devil. I can't guarantee the article will be any less offensive, however.

<p>

We've got an exciting issue this time.  Alec Rawls is my favorite as usual, and his articles on Blacks and Guns are featured on page 7.  Brian Ball also wrote a great satirical editorial that needs to be read on page 6. 

<p>

Blacks and the Middle East turned out to be an incidental theme of much of this issue--I had an interesting conversation with an African American friend, Zach Myers, found on page 5.  We also have an article about a liberal "Spoken Word Poetry Reading" that looks like it has something to do with black and hispanic culture, and is somewhat incomprehensible to me. There's also a well-written article on a debate on Iraq by Piotr, and a few other points of interest, including, of course, our front-page features.

<p>

I've had an interesting week here at Stanford.  I was invited to two very liberal meetings, one at the Harmony House to discuss Amiri Baraka, and the other at Meyer, to be a panelist at a discussion on the Living Wage.

<p>

I've already cited an article that explains Amiri Baraka, the communist Israel-hating black poet-laureate of New Jersey who repeats and propagates anti-semetic Hezbollah lies in his "poetic expression."  Brian Ball does a good job discussing this issue in his piece. I mistakenly assumed, given my past experiences, that the vast majority of reasonable people would dislike Baraka and agree that he was deluded and insane, given just this information.  Instead, it turns out there are a great many supporters of him in the black community.  Why? Most of what he talks about is anti-oppresion activism, and his other features that I find distasteful, they enjoy.  First of all, apparently much of the black community hasn't had explained to them why communism has been irrefutably rejected and shown to be a vastly harmful and slavery-inducing economic system, both in practice and in theory.  Secondly, because of an overwhelming Muslim influence and no Jewish influence, they're only hearing "one side of the story" on Israel (Zach Myers was helpful in pointing this out to me). Talk about the need for black-Jewish dialogue...these people I spoke with are good people and well-intentioned, but they've been completely brainwashed.  Jews fought for black civil rights, but this community is helping to spread anti-Semetic nonsense. Either that, or my fellow Jews really are at fault.  Hrmm.  Why hasn't anyone contacted me about the Jewish conspiracy?   My mom is Jewish, I qualify.  I suppose that it's possible that these members of the black community are not confused, and it is I who am brainwashed, and the U.S. government and Israel knew all about 9/11 and allowed it to happen . The whole conservative community at Hoover and NRO and the Weekly Standard and the Editorial Board of the WSJ may be pulling the wool over my eyes.  Anyone?  Who is deluded here?  If it is me, I'm going to have some serious rethinking to do.

So, I was unable to communicate satisfactorily with the black community at the Amiri Baraka meeting, and I went off and talked to Zach and wrote an article on what I learned from him.  I think there is a lot to be gained from opening dialogue between the liberal black community and conservatives, and trying to understand our differences and why we think the way we do. As such, it is counterproductive to be ridiculing the people whom with I spoke. Despite this, I have trouble taking serisouly anyone who believes and explains such conspiracy theories about the United States (LaRouche, anyone?), while sitting with black friends in their "Palestine colors" and moaning about Israel, when places like the Arab and African governments exist out there. I suppose someone nobler than myself will have to bridge this gap.

<p>

The living wage forum was entertaining, but here, more than anywhere else, was reinforced the fact that my moderately conservative/libertarian political beliefs are not welcome on this campus.  The discussion in general was not about the practicality or necessity of a living wage, but whether "Stanford's offer was enough", and "think of the babies! The babies!"

<p>

I'm sorry, but the babies have nothing to do with minimum wages.  This is the problem with conservatism--it's based on what works, instead of random unrelated emotional appeals.  Ninety percent of the  young Stanford women and some large amount of the men in the room hear about "babies", and instantly I am evil and tiresome for wanting to argue against whatever this baby-caring-for nurse wants.

<p>

 The hospital needs to staff itself well enough to take care of all of the babies and other patients, and if it's not doing so, then it should get sued if a baby is hurt, or we should have an investigation to make sure the babies are being properly tended to.  If you need to pay a little more than going market rate to get a dedicated and skilled staff for the safety of patients, then that makes sense.  That's a separate issue.

<p>

What does not make sense is deciding that a section of a business can be efficiently and safely run for $100,000, and then deciding to spend $120,000 because "it's expensive to live around here."  If you can find donors who are willing to pay this extra money to the workers, then that's up to them.  But draining the University budget to provide unearned wages and an artificial incentive to people to remain at a job that is not actualizing their economic potential is silly.  

<p>

When others are willing to work for $10 and do quality work, paying $11 means you are creating an economic inefficiency and giving charity to the people who happen to be in the jobs.  Also, when contractors are willing to work for $8.50 and you carp about how it's "unfair" to allow people to work for so little, you forget that they would lose their voluntary jobs entirely if this contracting work was taken away from them and given to higher-salaried full-time workers.

<p>

The better solution is to educate these people, and to give money towards their education.  If you want these people to live in the area instead of moving to more affordable locations, teach them skills that will make them successful enough to live in this area.

<p>

"But then who would take the low-paying jobs?"

<p>

If you somehow managed to educate everyone around here and make their time more worthwhile, you'd see that these jobs paid more out of necessity, because fewer unskilled people were around.  Meanwhile, these current workers, generally minorities, would be educated and contributing more to society. It's racist to insuate that they are unable to learn higher skills...if you really care about helping them, figure out how to use money to make the time for them to learn and advance.  For a start, try less labor rallies and more night school.

<p>

"But what about the babies!  I want money!  Don't teach me how to fish, I deserve fish!  Babies!  Labor Rights!  I have a right to money!  Give me money! We have the right to be respected for our work!"

<p>

A "right" is not something that can be used to impose upon others--you are suggesting that you have a right for others to pay you more than your work is currently worth at a free market level. That is not a right, and it is not only bad for you and a bad example for your children, but bad for the economy and the rest of us as well. 

<p>

But if you're a liberal, you tuned me out several paragraphs ago.  Yay conservatism!  Enjoy the issue!
