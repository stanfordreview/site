Editor's Note
</font><br>

<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXIX/Issue_1/A_Word_From_The_Editor/images/joe.jpg" width=248 height=213 align=Left>

This is my last issue as Editor-in-Chief of the <i>Review</i>. No, despite what you'd think, they're not kicking me out...our paper actually supports the, and I quote, "hateful", "unsupported", "deluded 18th and 19th century views" in which I indulge, also known as modern conservatism and libertarianism to the rest of us. 

<p>

We just suckered a new guy into doing all the hard work.
On a more serious note, though, incoming Editor-in-Chief Piotr Kosicki is an erudite young conservative who knows more about history and international relations than anyone else on staff, and I am proud to pass on the torch to such a qualified successor. 

<p>

Maybe he'll finally answer those curious questions, like, "Do South Koreans really want us to withdraw our troops, given the deluded monsters to the north?", and "Or are they just confused liberals who know they can have our protection but want to harass us at the same time?" Piotr has some neat plans for his Ôreign', which I'm sure he'll tell you all about.

<p>

 As this is my last note, I also want to thank our dedicated staff, who consistently take time out from their busy Stanford-student schedules to make this paper work.  In particular, our layout manager Chris Baer has done a fabulous job of working late in the face of midterms and homework (and now, illness) to bring a very professional look to our paper.

<p>

But moving on, most student readers are liberals.  And I'm told they read my note to make themselves angry at me, so we're going to humor them.

<p>

<b>DISADVANTAGED MINORITIES AT STANFORD ARE ON AVERAGE WORSE AT MATH THAN OTHER STUDENTS! </b><i>Stanford admissions policies create unfortunately racist perspectives. Students that might do well in real disciplines at other schools are instead relegated to relatively useless fields like "Black Studies" or "Environmental Happiness and Liberal Dancing  with Trees", because they are unable to compete in useful majors at the level at which other students are admitted. <p>
If you took the ultra-liberal Stanford Peace and Justice Group, equipped them with modern weaponry  and electric generators, and put a hundred of them a thousand years back in time into the middle of Europe, they'd probably all be dead or peasants in about a week. So much for a Yankee in King Arthur's Court.  These people have no intelligent survival instinct whatsoever. Seriously. It's like they're even worse than the French at self-defense...defending yourself is evil to these guys. Not that I'd want to give them weapons.</i>

<p>

Whew.

<p>

If you really think about it though--at least, if you thought about it and were subjected to their email list as is the <i>Review</i> editor's duty to many campus lists, those SCPJ people really don't have many basic survival skills.  They're mostly people relying on emotion and international students from very controlled or disparate cultures, albeit a few colorful hippies and other random people. Don't get me wrong, they have good hearts, and they're great to talk to--if you don't pick an issue on which they're crazy. E.g., U.S. and Israel were behind 9/11, oil companies are behind the war, Israel committed great civialian massacres reminiscent of the Holocaust, government interference is the chief force behind economic growth, nobody but a few crazies are in favor of attacking Iraq, Condi is white, France politicians are sane, etc.

<p>

If you're not brought up with a healthy respect for the individual, for the proper role of a person in his own preservation and responsibility in the connotation of life, liberty, and property, you get some pretty distorted views. There comes a time when you need to stand up for yourself and take violent action, no matter how much a sane man detests war.  Flinching away from this distasteful respsonsibility is just that...neglecting your duty to yourself and your group because it involves unpalatable action. I feel that the vast majority of people in the United States understand these basic truths, because of the nation in which we live, and the liberty we have around us.  This is why we'll be able to make the difficult choice of going to war in Iraq, unless Saddam changes his tune in mid-beat.

<p>

European nations and other countries often do not instill this same sense of individual liberty to their populations. Their safety net takes away a lot of the individualistic self-preservation instinct that's needed when playing with fire in International Relations and evil dictators.

<p>

The posters at a recent European anti-war rally read "No to War" in the CNN forefront and "Capitalist Terror" in the unmentioned background.  Socialism, communalism, and the like are in many ways branches on the same tree of happy-go-lucky liberty-be-damned philosophy.  We don't want to take responsibility for ourselves, let's make everyone do things for us and act at our level under our rules, regardless of what they would do were they left to their own accord.  Because we're smarter and happier and we know what's best for you.  Oui, oui, Inspections forever! The fact that these inspections are only going on because of the credible use of force does not exist on my plane of reality! Living wage! More government to End Injustice! Insert Liberal Buzzword Chant Here! Nonsensical feel-good cry! (Racial group) Power!

<p>

((next week in the "Real News:"
<i>Chris Fish is a hateful, racist bigot. The only point I see in his article is that he is frustrated and confused, and feels the need to lash out and hurt people, because he cannot deal with his feelings. How can anyone harbor such ridiculous views, in our modern day culture of multiculturalism and tolerance? He shows that racism, in its darkest form, is still alive and well today. Anti-racist groups in the black community should be given more money to support tolerance and to get rid of people like Joe. 

<p>

With regard to his claims: Where's your evidence, Joey? His prose, in fact, harkens back to ancient 19th century deluded views on racial...etc....etc...Joe is a bigot and our community should not talk to him...etc....etc...let's take his black fraternity brother off the community email list for talking to him, because we are spiteful girls...etc...Joe is bad. Jewish dollars cause problems.))</i>

<p>

Yep, look what I put up with for fighting the good fight.  Their issue that has three separate attack articles on me, I keep in my room as a badge of honor.  Share the love.

<p>

Since I'm leaving, I needed to stock people up on material to keep the death threats coming in. But moving on from people who want me dead, to typical liberals, who just disagree with my views and realize that moderate conservatives do not merit death, I am going to discuss a little more of my offensive text.
I bet it makes you angry to hear that if you picked 10 blacks and 10 hispanics and 20 whites/asians at random from the Stanford population, and made them do math tests...this diverse group of students would probably band together and make you eat those tests.  What student here is going to let you make them do math tests?

<p>

But more importantly, if you somehow got them to agree to take those tests, because of the admissions policies we use, the latter group would almost surely do significantly better on average.

<p>

This is bad. The very worst thing you can do for our school in terms of diversity and race is create an unbalanced society where a rational person looks around him and eventually sees that the minorities he has met, while bright people, are simply, on average, not as intellectually qualified as their peers. It's true. Affirmative action is not some magical formula that takes equally-qualified applicants that are nearly identical, and picks the black one.  That is a plain and simple lie.  I have genius friends who scored high 1500's on their SATs, won national chess championships, started clubs, won big contests, and competed in varsity athletics all at once.  And they did not get in, while black students who scored 1300 from a similar middle class background with a few clubs and sports and activities, did.  They may be impressive given the racial norms, but their intellectual development is clearly not at the same level as these other students, who unfortunately happened to be geniuses born to middle class white backgrounds.  

<p>

It's simply ridiculous that this is tolerated and that the facts are shoved aside for "nearly equal" explanations that don't do justice to reality.  Affirmative action makes the class less impressive than it could be, and it creates an atmosphere where hispanic and black people on average aren't as intellectual. Yes, I have super-intelligent hispanic and black friends who deserve to be here. But an atmosphere where the average intellect of races is vastly different only serves to create divides that need not, should not exist.  

<p>

Another point I made refers to "useless discplines".  This is an exaggeration. Black Studies scholars study a field that needs to be objectively analyzed so that we can make intelligent decisions about our culture based on a true understanding of inequities that exist. This doesn't mean blind homage to all that is liberal...but it does need to be acknowledged in an intelligent way.  It's important both to criticize and work on methods to address problems that exist in our culture...instead of writing inflammatory dialogue that sounds hateful and doesn't help the situation, it would be more useful for both sides to get together and...oops, I'm out of space.  Oh no! Oh well.  Thanks for a great volume.
