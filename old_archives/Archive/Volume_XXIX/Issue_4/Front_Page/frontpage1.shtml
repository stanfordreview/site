Robert Fisk Speaks on Campus
</font><br>

<b>by Charles Hallford</b><br>
Staff Writer<p>

<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXIX/Issue_4/Front_Page/images/fisk.jpg" width=240 height=197 alt="Fisk" align=right>

Thursday, November 21st journalist Robert Fisk, of the British daily newspaper The Independent, gave a speech at Stanford entitled "War and Peace."  He spoke of his experiences as a Middle East Correspondent and accused Western media of giving biased reports.  

<p>

"September the 11th did not change the world," Mr. Fisk said in his speech.  "Perhaps America has changed."  He further requested of U.S. media, "Let's stop saying September 11, 2001 has changed the world."  Mr. Fisk also objected to calling our military action in Afghanistan and/or Iraq a "War on Terror."  
<p>

Mr. Fisk also claimed that the possible future War on Iraq is an attempt by the Bush administration to redraw territorial lines in the Middle East in a way ideal for Israel's interests.  In response to this claim, one audience member cried, "That's bulls***!" Within a matter of seconds, listeners supportive of Mr. Fisk shushed their fellow audience member.

<p>

Then Mr. Fisk recalled how a group of Afghan refugees, many of whom had lost relatives in the recent U.S. bombing, attacked him on December 8th of last year.  They dragged him out of his car and beat him so badly that he could not see for all the blood in his eyes.  If not for a Muslim clergyman who saved him, they might have killed him.  Shortly thereafter, along with reporting on the incident, Mr. Fisk wrote an article entitled, "My beating by refugees is a symbol of the hatred and fury of this filthy war."  The following Christmas Mr. Fisk received numerous Christmas cards saying the senders wished the refugees had finished the job.

<p>

He also recalled that he "was crossing the Atlantic on September 11th."  That day Mr. Fisk wrote an article entitled "The Wickedness and Awesome Cruelty of a Crushed and Humiliated People."  In this article Mr. Fisk said that the war to come "is not the war of democracy versus terror that the world will be asked to believe in the coming days."  He further said, "Our broken promises, perhaps even our destruction of the Ottoman Empire, led inevitably to this tragedy."  In response to this article, Mr. Fisk said that people called him "a total nutcase," described him as "drooling venom," and told him, "You are actually supporting evil."

<p>

<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XXIX/Issue_4/Front_Page/images/fisk_book" width=240 height=378 alt="Book" align=right>

Mr. Fisk said he has interviewed Osama bin Laden three times. In one interview the terrorist said, "I pray the God will allow us to turn the U.S. into a shadow of itself."

<p>

According to Mr. Fisk, Mr. bin Laden's power and influence come from what he says not what he does. The most popular things among the Muslim world that Mr. bin Laden has said are his demands that UN sanctions on Iraq end and that the Israelis be driven into the sea.

<p>

Later in his speech, Mr. Fisk showed a transparency of a Newsweek magazine cover.  The headline read, "Terror Goes Global."  Underneath read, "Exclusive: Bin Laden's International Network."  However, according to Mr. Fisk, the picture on the cover was of a Palestinian in West Bank at a funeral for Palestinians killed in action.  Mr. Fisk said he had "nothing to do with Bin Laden."

<p>

Then, in order to illustrate how unpopular The Independent is in some countries, Mr. Fisk showed a newspaper cartoon portraying The Independent as a rabid dog.  Rabid dogs need to be shot.  Therefore, Mr. Fisk concluded, the cartoon was saying The Independent should be eliminated with extreme prejudice.

<p>

After that, he showed a couple of videos about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  One was about a Palestinian family being forced to move out of their home by the Israeli government.  In the other Mr. Fisk talks with a Palestinian about his experience in a violent situation with Israeli soldiers and walks through the site of that combat.
<p>

Mr. Fisk concluded his speech and then opened the floor for questions.  The first questioner asked, "What do you propose we should do about Saddam?"

<p>

At first, Mr. Fisk slowly built up to his answer.  During this build-up, he asked if we did not care about human rights ten years ago then why should we care about them now.  Also he said that we might need to ask what to do about North Korea if we are to ask what to do about Iraq.  

<p>

However, he did finally answer the question.  "Let's try not to create any more monsters," he said.  "Let's find out if he indeed has any weapons of mass destruction."  Mr. Fisk also stated that if our soldiers invade Iraq, "Maybe they will find weapons of mass destruction."

<p>

Next Mr. Fisk claimed that the possible future War on Iraq would have nothing to do with fighting terrorism and everything to do with oil.  He also said that he has met very few Americans who approve of a war with Iraq.  Then Mr. Fisk asked a question of his own, "Why shouldn't Iraq have nuclear weapons?"  He reasoned that if we allow Israel to have nuclear weapons we must be consistent and let Iraq have them as well.

<p>

Later in the question & answer segment, Mr. Fisk said that the American press has developed a good, cozy relationship with those in power.  He claimed that if journalists question their country's foreign policy at a moment of crisis, when it needs to be questioned the most, then they are cut off and alienated.  Thus, he said that they "don't write what they know."  He contends that they are working to gain favor of those in power, which is not what a journalist should do.  "Our job should be to monitor the centers of power," he stated.

<p>

Then an audience member asked Mr. Fisk how we should get accurate information about world news.  Mr. Fisk replied, "Read The Independent."

<p>

Another questioner sought to confirm that the Afghani refugees who beat him also robbed him.  Mr. Fisk said that he was only robbed of his contacts book and that he thinks someone else may have taken it from him.  In Afghanistan Mr. Fisk offered a reward for the book equivalent to 10,000 Afghani dollars, but nobody returned it.

<p>

The same questioner asked why anybody should trust Mr. Fisk's reporting over anyone else's.  Mr. Fisk gave no reason to do so and simply replied that no one has to trust him, although he suggests they do.

<p>

Another audience member asked if he could say whether or not the U.S. knew about the September 11th attacks before they happened.  Mr. Fisk replied that he had done no research on the subject and therefore could not comment on it.
