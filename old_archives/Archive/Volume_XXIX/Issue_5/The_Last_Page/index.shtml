Using Skin Color is not Diversity, it's Racism
</font><br>

<b>by Victoria Schwartz</b><br>
Contributing Writer<p>

Diversity. The word has certainly been thrown around a lot lately as the Supreme Court, the nation, and now Stanford University tries to come to terms with the debate over affirmative action. But what does it really mean? Is the diversity that we want really a diversity of hair color, eye color, skin color? Or is what we really mean when we say that we support diversity is that we support diversity of opinions, backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs?  I believe that a confusion between these two concepts is where we have gotten into trouble.

<p>


The Stanford community is in affirmative action frenzy. Every day we hear of recent meetings, town halls or rally to show support for affirmative action. Even more significantly, recently President Hennessy endorsed affirmative action in a presentation to the faculty senate. While I fully believe that all of these individuals and actions are well-intentioned, they result from falsely equating affirmative action and diversity.

<p>

Supporters of affirmative action policies (such as the one at the University of Michigan, being reviewed by the Supreme Court) are making the assumption that race automatically contributes to diversity. Is this really the case? Let me take as an example the issue of an African-American male who grows up in Southern California, comes from an uppermiddle class background, and attends a private school. Does the mere fact that his skin is darker than mine mean that he has something extra to contribute to the community?  I feel we would probably all agree that it isn't his skin color that adds something to the community. I am a strong believer in diversity. I very much appreciate the fact that I have had roommates from a variety of racial, economic and geographic backgrounds. However, race by itself does not mean someone is bringing something unique. Many times this is the case. But in these cases we are not really giving priority to people's race, but rather to the uniqueness of their beliefs, experiences or backgrounds that make them an individual, which may or may not result from their race. This is the problem with the University of Michigan policy. Their policy automatically gives extra points to an individual based on the color of their skin. Not based on their socioeconomic background, not based on their politics or beliefs, perspectives or experiences. No. They are given points on the basis, and solely on the basis, of race; this is racism. 

<p>

I have less of a problem with Stanford's so-called "affirmative action" policy than I do that of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan gives points to people on the basis of their race without looking at the individual themselves. They do not determine whether that individual actually has any special attributes as a result of belonging to that race--whether that individual even identifies culturally or otherwise with that race. No, simply being able to check the box on the form gives them an automatic boost in the process. While I am not certain, my guess is that if an individual had three white grandparents, and one African American grandparent, and grew up in an entirely white cultural home, that would still probably suffice to get the extra points. I must be missing something, if that is not racism. At Stanford, at least in my hopes, things work a little bit different. The editorial staff of the Stanford Daily attempted to convince us that both systems are the same, but even in their description of the two systems it should be bluntly obvious that this is simply not the case. Stanford [supposedly] considers the race of individuals in a way in which they consider the difference between this individual adding to our racial statistics, and this individual adding true diversity. By looking at individuals as individuals and not merely as stereotypical minorities, Stanford overcomes my main objections to the affirmative action policy at the University of Michigan. I hope that Stanford would consider attempting to add true diversity to the school by admitting individuals not on the basis of race, but by looking at individuals' unique experiences as it comes out in their personal essays as a measure of determining real diversity. 

<p>

This leads us back to the question of the purpose of diversity. For example, I recently attended my first Jewish-Muslim dialogue and learned a tremendous amount from individuals whose backgrounds are very different from my own. I believe that this is the benefit of going to a "diverse" school: being able to learn from people who are different from me, and having them learn from me. In this context I would like to question the housing policy currently existing at Stanford. If the purpose of diversity is to learn about people of different backgrounds, then how can that purpose possibly be served when many of the minorities live together in ethnically segregated housing? Sure I know that you can say that 50 pecent of those dorms are non-ethnic, but that still leaves the great majority of us who don't live in those dorms without an opportunity to interact with these communities. I fully support cultural centers. I feel that the black community should absolutely be given a larger community center and El Centro Chicano is a wonderful resource. However, I deeply question the decision to segregate minorities in residential life. I had a wonderful time on a recent Casa Zapata  ski trip, but the experience really solidified to me how much our ethnic housing robs the rest of the community. I realized that the Latino community has a vibrant culture which I knew nothing about because of my very limited opportunities to interact with them.  The result of ethnic housing at Stanford is that the remaining housing becomes much more homogenous. The Stanford housing policy offends the principle of diversity that proponents of affirmative action seem so fond of. 

<p>

I am constantly surprised to hear of minority groups on campus standing up to vocally support affirmative action, as a policy which lowers standards for minorities and assists them to get in to "remedy past injusticies." In my experience in my classes there are a great deal of extremely qualified, brilliant, and talented minorities who go to this school. Minorities whom I am absolutely convinced would have been admitted even if the admissions office had no idea regarding their race. I can't understand why these individuals are not appalled by affirmative action. They worked hard in school, they pursued extracurricular activities, they did everything right, only now the cold truth is that when people see them they automatically assume that they are the product of affirmative action. This is hard for us to admit. However I believe that we all know that it is the truth. When we see minority students in our classes, many of us immediately think that they are probably not going to be the best students in the class. We reject the thought, after all it is certainly not politically correct. We don't even want to believe it, however unwittingly the thought often creeps into our minds unchecked. What is responsible for this reaction? Affirmative action. The original purpose of affirmative action was to give minorities a boost up so that they could compete fairly in a society that was inherently racist. I think we can proudly say that we have reached a time when that purpose is no longer necessary. Minorities exist in all aspects of life, in every position, career, and socioeconomic sphere. Our National Security Advisor, one of our Supreme Court Justices, and our Secretary of State are all African American. Minorities no longer need the boost that arguably they might have needed in the days after the Brown decision. The purpose of affirmative action was fair competition, nowadays the results are anything but. 

<p>

If you want to talk about socioeconomic affirmative action, I am all ears. Until then I must firmly conclude that affirmative action is unfair to minorities and to the entire student body. I urge students to write a letter to President Hennessey opposing his amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of affirmative action. If he wants to write a letter in favor of diversity, all the more power to him, but extra points for skin color should not be a part of any educational system under the Constitution of the United States.
