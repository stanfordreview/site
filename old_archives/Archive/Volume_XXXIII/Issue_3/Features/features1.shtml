            <p>With a largely Democratic constituency and twelve years of Congressional experience behind her, House Representative Anna Eshoo seemed poised to win California&rsquo;s 14th district on November 2, according to Stanford Political Science Professor, Simon Jackman. Eshoo apparently felt likewise; she wagered a win on only 75% of her campaign earnings.</p>
            <p>In the period from January 1, 2003 to October 13, 2004, Representative Eshoo&rsquo;s campaign has received $864, 253 in donations but $238, 050, over 25% of the funds, have been passed on to other committees and campaigns. </p>
            <p>Of her donations, the California representative contributed $200,000 to the Democratic Congressional Committee but divided $25,500 among 18 handpicked Democratic congressional candidates. These congressmen are running in states varying from Washington to Kentucky to New York, and include both incumbents and first-time candidates.</p>
            <p>Representative Eshoo&rsquo;s delegation of her campaign donations represents a growing trend that &ldquo;has really taken off in the last six years,&rdquo; according to Tony Raymond, co-founder of Political Money Line, a non-partisan campaign finance and lobby research organization.</p>
            <p>Apparently strong candidates such as Eshoo, who garnered 68% of the 2002 election&rsquo;s votes, are choosing to spread seemingly excess money to further their careers both in their parties and in Congress. Raymond hypothesizes that approximately 60% of incumbents donate campaign money to either their central party or directly to party allies.</p>
            <p>While Jackman considers donating directly to other candidates a relatively new phenomenon, Raymond finds the shifting of campaign funds through central party committees particularly prevalent, especially on the left. He hypothesizes: &ldquo;Democrats have a more difficult time getting money. The [Democratic] Congressional Committee is really relying on its members. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;The leaders have to ask for the funds. Some members are really willing to pony up all the way but with others it takes a little urging.&rdquo;The push from the central committee can come once it becomes clear who is ahead financially in their campaigns.&ldquo;Sometimes we&rsquo;ll highlight on our home page who has excess money,&rdquo; Raymond said, &ldquo;and very shortly after they&rsquo;ll give money to the committee.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;If an incumbent has a sufficient war chest, they&rsquo;re donating the excess money to the party [to] garner favors.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Eshoo and other strong candidates also take an additional approach for gaining Congressional support by directly giving to other campaigns. Jackman foresees that because of this, when leadership elections occur, Eshoo &ldquo;will have a coalition to call on for favors.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>He also surmises though that the inter-party donations will cause long term consequences such as increasing<br>
              the polarization between the two parties in Congress. Jackman thinks indebtedness will encourage voting in party blocs as well as tie moderates down to their parties.</p>
            <p>Both Sarah Rizk and Sam Lipsick, Democrats from California&rsquo;s 14th district and undergraduate students at Stanford University voted for Eshoo on the 2nd. While both were unaware of how Eshoo was distributing her campaign money, neither plan to change their votes, even in light of the new information.</p>
            <p>Lipsick said, &ldquo;If she has been in office since 1992, she obviously has enough funds from her political campaign to enable her to be reelected. Therefore spending a portion of her campaign contributions on other Democratic representatives seems somewhat reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Rizk agreed: &ldquo;She has continued support here and she should put the money towards other Democrats who are trying to gain support.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Lipsick added, &ldquo;If citizens have put enough trust in Anna Eshoo to put her in office then they can at least trust that she will be fiscally responsible with her campaign contributions.&rdquo;</p>
