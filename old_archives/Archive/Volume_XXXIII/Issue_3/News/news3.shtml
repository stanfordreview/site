            <p>This year&rsquo;s freshmen found themselves apprehensive in anticipation of Full Moon On the Quad, but after experiencing it with a spin on tradition, they were generally pleased as they left the event.</p>
            <p>Entering students hadn&rsquo;t participated in events comparable to Full Moon before. Organized events that included kissing random people and acquaintances under the full moon were definitely not prevalent on most high school campuses.</p>
            <p>Therefore, on the days approaching Full Moon, many members of the class of &lsquo;08 were wondering what they might be getting themselves into. Freshman Stephanie Oberfoell noted one of the most common points of nervousness &ndash; health &ndash; when she expressed her concern whether &ldquo;these random people were going to be worth Mono or a cold.&rdquo; People wondered if they would get sick, and if the trade-off was worth it. </p>
            <p>Then, there was worry over relationships. Freshmen who had left their boyfriends and girlfriends behind at home, or at other colleges, wondered if Full Moon constituted cheating. For some, Full Moon meant random kisses, not necessarily constituting a threat to relationships. For others, Full Moon seemed like overt infidelity, but nonetheless, an important part of the freshman social experience at Stanford.</p>
            <p>As Wednesday night approached, fears were smoothed over in the minds of many freshmen. Peer Health Educators stressed the existence of the &ldquo;Listerine Table&rdquo; where one could make a pit-stop to kill some of the germs accumulated during the kissing activities. Anne Friedman&rsquo;s article in The Daily resolved some relationship issues as she rationalized how participating in Full Moon was not cheating.</p>
            <p>Also stressed was the difference between this year&rsquo;s event and events of the past. Unlike past years, this highly organized Full Moon was to include kissing alternatives like temporary tattoos and tarot card readings to ease the pressure to kiss. The live band would also pose as a focal point for those not-so-interested in the other shenanigans. In short, this year, it would be acceptable and enjoyable both to kiss or not to kiss.</p>
            <p>Thanks in part to these developments there was a large turnout in the quad on Wednesday night. Some people found the random kissing awkward at first; others thought it was awkward the whole time. Freshman Marci Pepper thought the environment was &ldquo;more chaotic than awkward&rdquo; due to the masses of people in close proximity to each other. Another freshman took advantage of the henna tattoos noting that &ldquo;I thought it was nice to have alternatives to making out with strangers.&rdquo; Many people, in fact, looked as if they were having an exciting, adventurous evening.</p>
            <p>So who kissed who? Full Moon seemed to be moving away from its roots of the freshman-senior kiss. According to one freshman boy, &ldquo;Not a lot of freshman boy/senior girl kissing seemed to be going on...I ended up kissing mostly girls I knew. I felt awkward going around asking who the seniors were.&rdquo; Likewise, some freshman girls felt similar discomfort when senior boys went around calling out for freshman girls. &ldquo;I thought it was a little scary that these older guys only wanted to make out with younger girls,&rdquo; noted one freshman girl. The trend shifted towards kissing whomever one felt comfortable kissing, not just freshman with seniors. </p>
            <p>While not every freshman kissed or was kissed by a senior, most people say they had a good time, despite the early misgivings. For example, after Full Moon, one member of the Class of &lsquo;08 asked, &ldquo;When else do you have the opportunity to walk through a crowd of people, choose the ones you want to make out with, and do it?&rdquo;</p>
