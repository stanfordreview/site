            <p>This election was very difficult for me. I am now more certain than ever that I believe in the Republican principles of limited government and strong defense. Yet, I&rsquo;m confronted with the reality of the Bush administration&rsquo;s ballooning of government debt and increasingly questionable foreign policy. On the other hand, the alternative is a senator in favor of pushing through the largest government takeover of health care in American history and raising taxes on the 900,000 small businesses that form the backbone of our economy. Not to mention, it is not clear that Kerry&rsquo;s foreign policy will be any better than Bush&rsquo;s. Given my opposition to several of President Bush&rsquo;s policies and absolute abhorrence of Kerry&rsquo;s entire philosophy, plus the relative insignificance of my vote thanks to the Electoral College, I decided that I would be a one-issue voter in this election&hellip; and it&rsquo;s probably not the one issue that you are thinking of.</p>
            <p>It is no secret that George Bush faced the potential of one of the worst recessions in recent history. Stock prices and earnings were out of sync to a greater extent than any time in the last twenty years and consumer confidence was quickly waning. In order to counteract the quickening recession, Bush cut taxes in hopes of spurring the economy.<br>
              And, sure enough, there were the liberals to cry the standard line of &ldquo;tax cuts for the rich.&rdquo; But were Bush&rsquo;s tax cuts really a giveaway for the rich? As it turns out, given some perspective and willingness to do research, I think the facts present a different reality.</p>
            <p>Behind the cry of &ldquo;tax cuts for the rich&rdquo; is our progressive income system. In 1980, the top 5% of American income earners paid 37% of total tax revenue. In 2003, the top 5% of American income earners paid 53% of total tax revenue. In other words, the continually more progressive tax system has made it impossible to cut taxes equally across the board and create a tax cut that will not be labeled as a &ldquo;tax cut for the rich.&rdquo; As it turns out, despite the fact that the top 5% of income earners pay 50% of tax revenue, only about 30% of Bush&rsquo;s tax cuts went to those same income earners. Furthermore,<br>
              it should be fairly obvious that the top 5% of income earners are not necessarily the &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; though they are often labeled as such by Democrats. The reality is that the TRUE rich, the people that SHOULD be taxed more are people like John Kerry who are basically gold digging leeches on society, garnering wealth from others hard work. While most Americans in the top income bracket probably pay somewhere around 50% of their income to the government, the release of John Kerry&rsquo;s tax receipts indicates that he paid about 13% of his income to the government. Why? Because he is not part of the productive wing of America, but living off of an inheritance placed in tax-free securities. </p>
            <p>So, what actually happens when we cut taxes? Well, using Reagan&rsquo;s tax cuts as a model, it turns out the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; according to Democrats may actually end up paying MORE taxes. Under Reagan the top 5% of income earners went from paying 37 percent to 44 percent of government revenue, despite Reagan&rsquo;s tax cuts for the highest bracket. The reason is that Reagan&rsquo;s tax cuts pulled America out of a recession caused by high taxes and generated many more high income earners. Wages for everyone actually went up, on average, and everybody benefited.</p>
            <p>Though the data may be too early to discern, Bush&rsquo;s tax cuts appear to have behaved similarly. Despite inheriting a recession, the Bush administration has in the past year seen the creation of 1.6 million new jobs, a rise in home ownership, a decrease in unemployment to 5.4%, a lower &ldquo;misery index&rdquo; than the average for the seventies, eighties and nineties, a revival of stock markets that are in line with earnings and doing relatively well, and several quarters of moderate to excellent economic growth, including a quarter of the best GDP growth in the last twenty years. All the while, hourly wages have actually increased under Bush by about 2% after adjusted for inflation, debunking the common line from democrats of a &ldquo;shrinking middle class.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>So in the broader context of this election and America&rsquo;s future what does this all mean? Here it goes: I want to see America remain a superpower in the world. I am proud to live here and I am proud of our accomplishments. I&rsquo;m proud that we were first to put a man on the moon, first to propose that all men are created equal, first to propel the world into the digital age, first to fly, first to develop atomic power, first to... and, thinking more about it, I now believe that the greatest threat to American power is not terrorism. It is a country that recognizes the values that brought us here to a greater extent than we do. One might call that country Japan, India, or, perhaps most likely, China. I will just say it: the economy IS everything. It is the reason we live the best lifestyle in the world, it is the reason we were the largest innovators of the 20th century. It is the reason we are the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world, it is the reason we can pay for the best army in the world. It is the reason we have electricity and running water in every home in America. It is the reason that $500 American dollars will buy a home in most countries. It is the reason that Americans will be evacuated before everyone else from the most war torn countries in the world and, perhaps most importantly, it means something philosophically as well. </p>
            <p>Historically, we have been the most capitalist country on Earth. Our founders prized individual rights above collective rights in nearly every situation. We do not have many of the supposed &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; touted by the left in our Constitution, but the INDIVIDUAL rights touted by Locke, Hobbes and Smith. And, in doing so, we have ironically managed to produce a country that respects human rights to a greater extent than most countries founded on collective rights. As it turns out, our heavily capitalist system has produced the best lifestyle for everyone, including the &ldquo;poor.&rdquo; I fear that we are losing sight of how we got here. We all supposedly know that socialism doesn&rsquo;t work... but few people are aware or complaining about the fact that transfer payments have gone from 27 percent to 60 percent of federal spending in that last 50 years. As it turns out, government redistribution of wealth is now the single largest federal budget item. We spend more money making transfer payments than we spend on defense, education and infrastructure combined. China, on the other hand, scoffs at our ignorance while they gain market share and will soon rival America in GDP and economic influence. </p>
            <p>I suppose my bottom line is that &ldquo;capitalism and limited government has produced the most economically powerful state in the history of our planet, and economic power IS world power.&rdquo; Putting the election in this focus... I think it has made my choice incredibly clear. I won&rsquo;t say who I have chosen to vote for, but I will say this: I am voting for the candidate that will target the greatest threat to American prosperity: government. I don&rsquo;t want to grow up in a socialist America and I don&rsquo;t want America to fall victim to the apathy bread by big government spending and regulation.</p>
