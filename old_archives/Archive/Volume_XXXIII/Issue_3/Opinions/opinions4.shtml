            <p>It&rsquo;s hard to know what is to be made of today&rsquo;s 50% approximate divorce rate. Why is today&rsquo;s rate so much higher than previous generations? Are we less mature and getting married too young? Do half of our grandparents hate their spouses? Are human beings not meant to have a life partner? All of these questions have been left unanswered. However, as a greater percentage of our society engages in the practice of divorce, the institution of marriage becomes more degraded and the decision to get a divorce becomes more accepted and mainstream. I argue that divorce is harmful to society&rsquo;s values, harmful to children left to single parents and is a propagation of a selfish &ldquo;get all you can when you can&rdquo; mentality that disturbingly is gaining steam in America today. </p>
            <p>This is a very loaded issue in today&rsquo;s society largely because 50% of people my age can tell you about their own personal experience with divorce. However, my parents have been married for over 25 years, my grandparents for over 70 (Yes that&rsquo;s ages 92 and 93 &ndash; married at 22) so I&rsquo;m giving an &ldquo;outsider&rsquo;s&rdquo; look at divorce. I believe that people in today&rsquo;s society are more immature and selfi sh than our grandparents at the same age. Many people rush to get married in their young twenties without having a strong sense of self. Perhaps today&rsquo;s world is tougher and more competitive professionally than the world that greeted our grandparents. This would mean that people would need more time to grow into themselves and really establish their own personal values system. I believe this is a theory that is possibly true. It&rsquo;s quite difficult to establish yourself in a career today. Schooling and working are both done on intense levels for all people, even those not going to Stanford. Dealing with these pressures could slow down or delay personal development. This could explain the large divorce rate for people who are getting married at young ages; just out of school, etc. I support Dr. Phil 27 rule to cut out a lot of these divorces. That is, society is unwilling to give you a marriage license until both partners are over age 27. This would force many young couples to live together and learn about each other before being able to jump into marriage. </p>
            <p>The main problems in society are created when these young couples have children. What happens to these children? Well, they end up living in single parent homes for most of their childhoods. The children then have a one-sided childhood where they get larger exposure to one parent. A bidding situation often forms where both parents vie for their children&rsquo;s love, with stuff (usually presents and/or trips), in an attempt to be the favorite parent. This situation is unfortunate because it adds confusion to the new situation. And this is for clean divorces. Ugly divorces can do much worse damage to the child than confusion and a loss of faith in marriage. Many suffer extreme psychological consequences from fighting parents, which themselves are suffering their own problems and therefore unavailable to their children. </p>
            <p>All children need the lessons and constant support from a 2 parent unit to have the best chance to develop as confident and productive human beings. The best super-mom or super-dad in the world could never provide the presence required from the other. It&rsquo;s impossible. Some divorced people get remarried and attempt to recreate the family unit with varying degrees of success. I commend these folks that make the best of their situations; however, I don&rsquo;t think this unit will ever be as great as a positive and loving nuclear family that lacks this destructive past. </p>
            <p>Anything from great situations to horrible situations are experienced by these children. I argue that one of the most profound side effects of divorce on children is the child&rsquo;s confusion on the foundation of and distrust of marriage. What process in a person&rsquo;s mind has to happen for them to trust marriage for themselves when they are older? Their seemingly perfect parents could not get along. How can they convince themselves their parents were flawed in judgment, were immature or a bad match. Many individuals are able to restore their confi dence in marriage, but others will lose their belief in marriage and will imitate their parents by getting divorced from future spouses. This is a shame. </p>
            <p>What can society do to mend this problem? Beyond Dr. Phil&rsquo;s 27 rule, I think society needs to restore the vision of divorce as a negative occurrence. With divorces so common we have washed out the failure element for those that participate. Divorce is a personal failure. People today often will point to a marriage ending as a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; event. Neither partner is responsible. People change. It happens. I&rsquo;d like to believe there is something more to it. I think we need to move to restore responsibility to this process. We should force people who want a divorce into mandatory counseling periods before we grant those divorces. That or we should put it on people&rsquo;s permanent records that they have failed in their personal lives. It should reflect on them. We could ask people when they apply for jobs if they have been divorced. We could have the judge who approves divorces put blame and reason on one or both people. Then we should make it legal for employers to ask who and why. This would force people to reflect on their own imperfections. People who get divorced should have to accept some failure. This restoration of the failure element to divorce would send a message to children that they should respect marriage and not treat the institution with flippancy or disrespect. Those with successful marriages would be looked up to more and held up as examples. </p>
            <p>To me, rising divorce rates, which I believe are approximately at their maximum, represent a changing American pop culture that undervalues honesty, caring for others and kindness and instead places value on greed, deception and personal gain at all costs. People are more distrustful of their mates then before and see divorce as a solution to their problems. Previously, people would try to work through difficult issues and in many cases those trying times were the foundation for renewed love and improved strength in marriage. Today, people hit hard patches and call it quits. I think we need to evaluate what values we are teaching children. Perhaps we should change our marketing and commercial standards. Perhaps we should stop supporting media that displays marriage as a loose or optional responsibility. A show called Desperate Housewives would not be shown to a five year old Alex Moore Jr. I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is, but I do know that divorce should be looked down on, as it was in the 1950s. People who get divorces should not be considered evil, but should acknowledge some fault in their personal life. Marriage should be considered an honored, revered and positive institution. Children should have these values reinforced to them by their married parents, television, school and society.</p>
