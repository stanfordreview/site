            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has fought for several months with his very own Likud Party about a &ldquo;disengagement&rdquo; plan for the so-called occupied territories, which include the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The first of Sharon&rsquo;s actions is the creation of a wall around Israel, securing it from the West Bank and isolating the Gaza Strip. While the wall will not follow the &ldquo;green line&rdquo; that divides Israel from the territories (it will in fact dig 10 miles into the West Bank, almost bisecting it) its intent is to create a separate Palestinian state. The wall&rsquo;s border do trace the Gaza Strip but leave 14.5% of the West Bank in the hands of the Israelis. The reason for this is because there are several areas within the West Bank, including East Jerusalem that the Israeli government sees as being necessary to its protection. In order to make sure that the land that the barrier encircles stays with Israel, Sharon has begun a 900 building project in order to create settlements in the 14.5% of the West Bank that he intends to maintain under Israeli control.</p>
            <p>Sharon&rsquo;s difficulty in the project lies in his own party&rsquo;s dissent against the partition plan. The Likud Party, which was established in the 1970s as a response to the growing number of attacks on Israel by its neighbors (1967 war and the 1973 war), have become more and more stringent about giving up land. The supporters of the party, many of them settlers who will be forced to move from their homes when the partition is complete, see giving up land as weakness. Many view the Arab world with mistrust and feel that if they were to sacrifice land for peace, there would be no end to the sacrifice. The idea that the Arab world will not be appeased until Israel disappears is a strong fear that plays itself out in the minds of many of the conservatives in the Likud Party.</p>
            <p>Objections to Sharon&rsquo;s building of the barrier as well as his subsidy of families in the settlements to move out have made it difficult for Sharon to keep going. The objections have been made on the side of the religious right, which sees this as the beginning to the end of Israel and from the UN and the Arab nations. To the UN and the Arab states surrounding Israel, as well as the Palestinians themselves, a forced barrier would create a difficulty for movement and trade between the two nations. Much of the infrastructure and labor in the territories is very closely linked to Israel, and it is difficult to imagine how a territory completely dependent on Israel could, on its own, be a viable state. </p>
            <p>Israel first established itself as being a democratic, Jewish state on the original biblical lands. In order to do so now, it must either deny voting rights to Palestinians, who, by 2015, will make up a majority of the population (this would make Israel not democratic), or allow the Palestinians in the territories equal rights (this would make the state lose its Jewish-ness because the Jews would be a minority). These tensions have led to the current situation. It would seem that most of the world sees this solution as unfit because it does not allow for a viable Palestinian state which could survive on its own. The wall, to many, seems an unjust barrier, blocking people from getting from one place to another. Furthermore, Palestinian fears that Israel will use the barrier to take their land are deepening. Palestinians point to the Israeli army&rsquo;s decision in October to make 18,000 acres of land between the barrier and the Green Line a &ldquo;closed zone,&rdquo; meaning no one may enter or exit without a permit. This includes the 12,000 Palestinians living in the area. They will have to apply for permits to continue living there and to exit and reenter the area. Israeli citizens and internationals of Jewish descent are exempt from any permit requirement. Despite this, 83% of Israelis support the wall and see it as the best option left to resort to in the conflict.</p>
            <p>Having looked at the facts, several thoughts arise. First of all, it seems that the world has forgotten what the Palestinians<br>
              themselves originally wanted. The PLO has recently changed its tactics from being an organization which wishes to oust Israel completely from the Middle East to being an organization that fights for its own land. Finally, after all of the conflicts and violence, Israel, it would seem, is making a huge sacrifice to give up a large portion of the occupied territories in order to create a Palestinian state. During many of the previous peace talks, getting either side to give anything up seemed impossible. Here, we are faced with an enormous Israeli sacrifice that no one seems to be seeing as such. Why aren&rsquo;t the newspapers ranting about Israel&rsquo;s amazing benevolence and commitment to compromise? Instead, the world seems to be focusing on the idea that Israel is not giving up all the land (it is keeping 14.5% of the West Bank for national security) and that it is not making it easy for the Palestinians to create a viable state for themselves. Never before has such a responsibility been placed on the Israeli government. Not only do they now have to give up land for peace, they must do this in a way that would make the creation of an enemy state more feasible. </p>
            <p>It is true that so much of the infrastructure and the lives of the Palestinians are closely connected to Israel. However, when the Palestinians were blowing up buses and discos in Beersheba and Tel-Aviv, the PLO did not seem to desire a joint state, which would be partially supported by Israel. Instead, they wanted their own state. In the business of trying to get what they wanted, they never stopped to look at what kind of state they wanted, or how it could be made viable under the circumstances. </p>
            <p>Today, no one seems to acknowledge what Israel has done in regards to the creation of a Palestinian state. Now that the Palestinians are on their way to receiving what they have always wanted, it would seem that they are still unhappy with the situation.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is important to see this from the Israeli side as well. What should Israel do to protect itself as well as compromise and give the Palestinians their own state? The only viable solution is to build a wall, which will protect Israeli citizens from the suicide-bombers that sneak in from the territories and at the same time, to move its citizens out of the West Bank and Gaza in order to facilitate the creation of a Palestinian state. Yes, there will be problems. Many Palestinians won&rsquo;t have access to healthcare or education because they are left on the poverty-stricken lands that they have settled. However, Israel cannot sacrifice anymore. After the amount of violence and aggression in the conflict, no one can expect Israel to fix the Palestinian problems.</p>
            <p>The old credo of the Palestinians in their desire for their own land will be forgotten. Instead, it will be replaced by a new cry of the unfairness of the wall and how it must be broken down to create a unified state with Palestinians and Israelis living together. This would serve the purposes of the Palestinians well because they would have a growing majority bloc in the government and would live off of the hard work that Israel has put into its growth. For the Israelis, such a state would signify the loss of a Jewish state, something that they have worked hundreds of years to attain. Soon no one will remember the Palestinians as those who desired their own state. No one will remember the Israelis for wanting to finally rid themselves of this conflict and give up land for peace. Once again, the international community will fault Israel and make it seem like they are unjust in not including the Palestinians in their specifically Jewish state and for leaving them destitute in the poverty of Gaza and the West Bank. It seems then, that the original Israeli fear that if they give up land, the Arabs will want more, is more real than ever. It is ironic how the original desires of the Palestinians are already forgotten and how the &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; state of Israel is once again at fault.</p>
