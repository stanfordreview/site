            <p>Former Reagan speechwriter Dr. Peter Robinson regaled the audience of the Stanford Review&rsquo;s Alumni Reunion with stories about the end of the Cold War and the two presidents who presided over the Soviet Union&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;'That wall has to come down,&rsquo;&rdquo; he recalled Reagan telling him in 1987. That June, reading from Robinson&rsquo;s text, the president declared: &ldquo;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Robinson was one of Reagan&rsquo;s speechwriters from 1983 to 1988, having previously served Reagan&rsquo;s vice president, George H. W. Bush, as a speechwriter. Now, Robinson works for the Hoover Institution, hosting its television show Uncommon Knowledge and writing books, such as his latest,<em> How Ronald Reagan Changed My Life</em>.</p>
            <p>The audience, of course, was no stranger to him. Robinson has been active in conservative circles for decades and has cultivated friendships with many Review alumni. Besides, Robinson is an amiable speaker, casually telling<br>
            jokes and engaging the 30-some men and women seated around breakfast tables at Palo Alto&rsquo;s Sheraton Hotel.</p>
            <p>Robinson also heaped tempered praise on the current Bush administration, but criticized the recent inaugural address as &ldquo;an overreach.&rdquo; He criticized the second inaugural address as being &ldquo;too abstract,&rdquo; asserting it was an error to define national liberty as dependent on liberty abroad and remonstrating President Bush for not mentioning any specific countries, including Iraq. </p>
            <p>And while commending the president for the recent free elections in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Palestine, as well as the tax cuts, Robinson also assailed the supposedly conservative White House&rsquo;s spending as exorbitant. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he said of those who compared Bush&rsquo;s speech to President Lincoln&rsquo;s famous second inaugural. </p>
            <p>The juiciest inside information, however, came when Robinson explained the origin of Reagan&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;tear down this wall&rdquo; line. In 1987 Robinson had been told that Reagan would be visiting West Berlin to give a foreign policy speech and that he should write that speech. Traveling around the city, he noticed the wall, the crosses of dead East Germans trying to escape from the Communists, and spoke with an American diplomat who said everyone had &ldquo;gotten used to the Wall.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Robinson then attended a dinner party, the guests at which assailed the Soviets and the Wall. One man had a family member living on the other side. Another described how every day on his way to work he passes by an East German soldier. &ldquo;One of us is the zookeeper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one is an animal&rdquo;&mdash;he just wasn&rsquo;t sure who was which. And then a woman told him forcefully that they had to &ldquo;get rid&rdquo; of the Wall</p>
            <p>.&ldquo;They thought of everything,&rdquo; Robinson says of the Communist security forces, who had placed neatly layered gravel around their side of the Wall. Their goal? Should the guards decide to sneak relatives across the border, they would have to explain the marks in the gravel the following morning.</p>
            <p>After many mutations of various phrases, Robinson stuck with &ldquo;tear down this wall&rdquo; and submitted his speech up the chain. Many people in the State Department and elsewhere opposed it, including Colin Powell.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;They were bastards!&rdquo; Robinson says jokingly. &ldquo;How dare they monkey around with our speech!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Reagan, Robinson says, loved the line and was determined to leave it in. He knew the people of East Berlin and oppressed citizens all the way to Moscow might him, and he wanted them to know he still stood with them. Within two years, the wall was down and the Soviet Union had collapsed.</p>
            <p>Countering the claim that Reagan was merely an actor who accidentally became president, Robinson explained that the former movie star had been known in Hollywood for his strong leadership, which had two principles. First, &ldquo;stake out your position.&rdquo; Second, &ldquo;get the best deal you can.&rdquo; Hence, Reagan employed both &ldquo;true believers,&rdquo; including Robinson, and the realists, such as George Schultz and Colin Powell, to actually get things done.</p>
            <p>Arnold Beichman, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution honored at the breakfast for a lifetime of service, asked Robinson if the first President Bush disliked Reagan. On the contrary, Robinson said, they had a &ldquo;complicated relationship,&rdquo; but Bush admired Reagan.</p>
            <p>Reagan himself, in Robinson&rsquo;s view, was &ldquo;the greatest Cold Warrior, second only to Arnold Beichman.&rdquo;</p>
