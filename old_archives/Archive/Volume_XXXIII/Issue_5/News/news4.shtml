            <p>The University of Colorado at Boulder retains a long-lived reputation of producing radical crackpots, but few rival Professor Ward Churchill in notoriety. At first glance, long-haired Churchill might come off as your usual Boulder hippie. One would expect him to conform to those harmless, peace-loving entities that give Boulder its essence. Unlike his cohorts, however, Churchill has received little tolerance or adoration from Americans. In fact, two body guards and a flak jacket were arranged to protect Churchill from dissidents during a speech he planned to deliver on February 3 at Hamilton College in New York.</p>
            <p>Churchill, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado, earned his infamy from producing one of the most inflammatory, unsubstantiated, and disrespectful pieces of writing in recent memory. In an essay entitled &ldquo;Some People Push Back&rdquo;: <em>On the Justice of Roosting Chickens</em>, Churchill justifies the September 11 attacks. Meanwhile, he also manages to demean the World Trade Center victims and Gulf War soldiers while heroizing Mohammed Atta and his colleagues. </p>
            <p>Although Churchill wrote the piece the day after the attacks and published it as part of a book in November 2003, the public did not begin to challenge the work until Hamilton College recently invited him to speak. In response to the invitation, the college received protesting e-mails, threats of violence, and numerous donation pledge withdrawals. Meanwhile&mdash;in Colorado&mdash;the governor has called for Churchill&rsquo;s resignation and the democratically-controlled legislature passed a resolution condemning the essay. All in all, it is clear that Churchill exploited his professorship and right to free speech and should be terminated from the University of Colorado in consequence.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, professors have a certain set of duties to fulfill. Not only do they serve as the world&rsquo;s role models for intellectualism&mdash;but they are also responsible for the education of the next generation. Society, in endowing an individual with a professorship, conveys an appreciation and acknowledgement of their credibility and the value of their work. It is obvious that society no longer wants to bestow the same privilege on Churchill. Professors cost money and&mdash;as Colorado Governor Bill Owens succinctly put it&mdash;taxpayers should not have to subsidize &ldquo;outrageous and insupportable&rdquo; views of people like Churchill.</p>
            <p>The outrageousness and insubstantiality of<em> Some People Push Back</em> is abundantly clear. Churchill mainly argues that America&rsquo;s &ldquo;myriad gross violations of international law&rdquo; in the first Gulf War and the following economic sanctions make Americans, themselves, responsible for the September 11 attacks. Churchill describes the aerial bombardments of the Gulf War as &ldquo;a Class I Crime Against humanity&rdquo; and contradicting &ldquo;every conceivable standard of &lsquo;civilized&rsquo; behavior.&rdquo; These accusations are astonishing considering that the Gulf War, in many respects,is thought of one of the first genuinely humane wars. Michael Lewis, in a 30-page report for The American Journal of International Law went so far as to say &ldquo;[on] the whole, there seems to be little doubt that the U.S. military took extraordinary measures to ensure that its air campaign complied with international law.&rdquo; He also details the fact that lawyers approved every single target location beforehand and that any failures can solely be attributed to &ldquo;the uncertainties of war.&rdquo; To criticize the progress that the American military has indeed made in minimizing civilian casualties is totally counterintuitive to the ideological pacifism of Boulderites.</p>
            <p>Churchill uses the aerial bombardment as a bridge to one of the most odious parts of his essay&mdash;an analogy between American civilians and the Nazis. He depicts the Gulf War as &ldquo;a performance worthy of the nazis during the early months of their drive into Russia&rdquo; and American citizens as German citizens ignoring a genocide on par with the Holocaust. He uses the doubling in infant mortality following economic sanctions in Iraq to justify his classification, but seems to ignore the fact that Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s exploitation of the Oil for Food program probably caused many of those deaths. </p>
            <p>The most devastating of Churchill&rsquo;s claims occurs when he asserts that the World Trade Center victims were not at all innocent, but &ldquo;little Eichmanns&rdquo; responsible for the deaths of five-hundred thousand children. Eichmann, of course, being a reference to Adolf Eichmann&mdash;the architect behind the exportation of three million Jews to nazi extermination camps. In a January 31, 2005 statement, Churchill tries to justify his categorization by saying that he did not mean to include children,<br>
              janitors, and firefighters in the &ldquo;little Eichmann&rdquo; group&mdash;as if that would help assuage the pain of the victims&rsquo; families. The presence of a CIA office in one of the twin towers, he argues, made it a &ldquo;legitimate target.&rdquo; The attack, he continues to argue, was the inevitable and justified result of America&rsquo;s engagement in Iraq.</p>
            <p>The attentive reader will realize that Churchill does not mention the word &ldquo;Kuwait&rdquo; throughout his article. He never addresses the fact that Iraqis incited US involvement with their invasion of Iraq. Throughout the article he criminalizes the gross disparity between US and Iraqi forces. But what about Iraq and Kuwait? Iraq ran through Kuwait in just a few days&mdash;vastly overpowering the Kuwaiti army. Unlike the US troops in Iraq, however, the Iraqis actually took advantage of their superiority in inhumane ways. Reportedly, Iraqis raped over five thousand Kuwaiti women and ordered the use of machine guns against civilian demonstrators. Yet, Churchill refuses to condemn these actions. His only actual reference to the Kuwaiti invasion is when he argues that &ldquo;the reason for the holocaust was/is simple&hellip;&lsquo; The world must learn that what we say, goes,&rsquo; intoned George [H. W. Bush].&rdquo; The rapes, the unprecedented aggression, and the exploitation of the Kuwaiti citizenry by Iraq go totally unmentioned.</p>
            <p>Churchill, in short, delivers an argument that serves society little value. Although intellectuals certainly need to critique the actions, beliefs, and traditions of society&mdash;there are certain acceptable mechanisms for doing such. Churchill clearly did not use these processes. Criminalizing people commonly understood to be innocent victims is totally unacceptable. Professor Churchill has a right to free speech, but he must acquiesce to behaving benevolently as a public university&rsquo;s professor. Professorships, as earlier discussed, are privileges&mdash;not rights. Society has already gone great lengths to insure academic freedom and tolerance of professors. In return, faculty members have an implicit duty to recognize and respect the limits of acceptability. Churchill certainly transgressed these limits and sets an extremely poor example for his students. Most assuredly, many Americans would be pleased if &ldquo;Professor at University of Colorado&rdquo; no longer appeared in Dr. Churchill&rsquo;s list of credentials.</p>
