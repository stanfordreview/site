            <p>*AHEM* I&rsquo;d like to begin with an apology. I made a mistake last week in giving credit to SIG for bringing Howard Dean to campus when in fact it was the wonderful people that make up the ASSU Speakers Bureau that were actually responsible. The Speakers Bureau has helped bring people like Carol Mosley Braun, John Kerry, Michael Moore and Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza to speak and has contributed tremendously towards the level of discourse on campus. It is groups like the ASSU Speakers Bureau that I am more than happy to contribute to as part of Stanford&rsquo;s fees system. Unfortunately, there are many groups that I am much less happy to be funding. </p>
            <p>For those that don&rsquo;t know Stanford&rsquo;s special fees system can be divided into two sections. Most groups that require substantial funding receive their fees pending student approval in the spring during elections. Other groups, however, make appeals for funding directly to the ASSU, which is taken out of the &ldquo;general fund&rdquo; if approved. Unfortunately, there is no way to ask for a group-specific refund when it comes to the general fund. Thus, I am forced to either ask for a complete refund or directly fund every group that is approved by the ASSU. Given the reality of the situation, I decided to explore where my money was going in order to determine whether it was appropriate to request a refund. As it turns out, two groups that receive such funding are the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice and the Stanford Labor Action Coalition. </p>
            <p>Among other things, the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice is dedicated to &ldquo;respect and justice for people of all races, religions, nationalities and religions.&rdquo; Wow&hellip; can&rsquo;t argue with that. On the other hand, the Stanford Labor Action Coalition is dedicated to &ldquo;shaping a stronger social justice movement through coalition building both within the Stanford community and beyond it.&rdquo; Sounds great to me!</p>
            <p>The other day, while I was busy with my standard routine of perpetuating racism and social injustice I ran across an email for a rally in White Plaza inviting me to stand up for change. As it turns out, the rally was sponsored by the Stanford Community for Peace. &ldquo;What a great opportunity to see peace in action,&rdquo; I thought. So I set out to see what this whole Stand up for Change thing was all about.</p>
            <p>Let me begin by saying that I was once a Bush supporter. Boy&hellip; was I ever misguided. Did you know that George Bush stole the election? Yeah, me neither, but now that I&rsquo;ve had a discussion with the lady with too much armpit hair, I&rsquo;m a believer! As it turns out, the 3 million vote margin that President Bush won by was really the product of a CIA conspiracy involving Area 51, alien autopsies and lots of tofu. I also learned a number of other interesting things that day. Did you know that the war in Iraq is really just an opportunity for Halliburton to tap a new market and to secure oil for imperialist AmeriKKKa? Never mind that Bill Clinton also gave Halliburton no bid contracts for reconstruction in Yugoslavia. Funny, I don&rsquo;t recall the mass protests over those contracts. Could it be that Halliburton has the best reputation in the world for facing the unique sorts of challenges presented in Iraq? No&hellip; of course not. I would also point out that most of the Halliburton contracts were awarded very early on in order to set reconstruction work in motion quickly. Most contracts WERE awarded based on competitive bidding. Oh well&hellip; details details. </p>
            <p>Thankfully my attention was drawn away from the hygienically challenged woman with the &ldquo;Pin the Grievance on Bush&rdquo; sign by an affiliate of the esteemed La Rouche campaign. This is where it really gets interesting. Did you know George Bush is a Nazi? Yeah, well at first I didn&rsquo;t believe him. But it turns out that Bush is perpetuating a fascist model developed by Milton Friedman to take over the world. Friedman? Fascist? &ldquo;Something must not be right here,&rdquo; I thought. When I pointed out the apparent contradiction I received a rather puzzled look. Then, after some more heated debate it just seemed to click. You see, as the La Rouche representative explained, &ldquo;facts aren&rsquo;t important&hellip;. How do you really KNOW anything?&rdquo; he asked. Wow, man, that&rsquo;s like, deep. </p>
            <p>Extremist rhetoric isn&rsquo;t just a product of the far left, however. As many may have witnessed, there was a rather elaborate demonstration in White Plaza the other day put on by a group of pro-life Stanford students that apparently shook a few horns. After talking to some friends, the problem with the display became clear: it was offensive! What, in particular, was offensive about such a display? Well, for one thing, the graves were symbolized by crosses. A&hellip; CROSS you say?!?! No, it gets worse. These whackos were actually expressing their&hellip; opinions! And, as we all know, opinions that might offend people are ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY a no no here at Stanford. Why, I certainly didn&rsquo;t come here to have my views challenged or to discuss the implications of various public policies. I came here to bask in my insulated bubble of &ldquo;progressive liberalism.&rdquo; Thus, I would like to propose a solution that I have borrowed from one of the best bands of our generation, The Offspring. I propose that Stanford surround White Plaza with gates displaying the following disclaimer:</p>
            <p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the disclaimer. That&rsquo;s right, the disclaimer! This American apple pie institution known as parental discretion will cleanse any sense of innuendo or sarcasm from [statements in White Plaza] that might actually make you think and will also insult your intelligence at the same time! So protect your family. This [part of campus] contains explicit depictions of things which are real. These real things are commonly known as life! So, if it sounds sarcastic, don&rsquo;t take it seriously. If it sounds dangerous, do NOT try this at home or at all. And if it offends you, just don&rsquo;t listen to it.</em></p>
            <p>You know, in all seriousness, I was going to originally write this editorial on how extremist rhetoric hurts the debate in this country. The more I think about it, however, the more clearly I see that even the most extremist positions ought to be put out in the open for scrutiny, so long as they are presented honestly and in the spirit of intellectual debate. Frankly, I&rsquo;m glad that Allen Wood told us about how Bush stole the election&hellip; so long as I don&rsquo;t have to pay for it. I&rsquo;m glad the pro-life demonstrators offended people by making them think about the moral implications of abortion. I ended up having some of the most enlightening discussions I&rsquo;ve had in a long time with complete strangers at both events. Where I draw the line is the point at which people are no longer presenting ideas in the spirit of discussion but in the spirit of hatred and self-insulation. I think that line is crossed when our President is compared to Hitler or when abortion clinic workers are threatened physically. So far, with a few exceptions, I have not seen that level of extremism here on campus. So, if by any chance Mr. Stinchcombe is reading this&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to let him know I&rsquo;ve found an answer to his nagging question, &ldquo;what kind of conservative [am I]?&rdquo; I believe that in certain settings, like a university, nobody should have the right to be free from ideas deemed &ldquo;offensive.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m a hell-raiser. 100%. And this is an open invitation for dialog, no matter how extreme&hellip;<a href="mailto:sixthousandrpm@yahoo.com"> sixthousandrpm@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
