            <p>I hate Ipods. For me, there is nothing more infuriating than seeing 60% of the student body walking around with the damn things locked in your ears. For me, its like everyone walking around with a no trespassing sign stapled clearly to their foreheads. I&rsquo;m in my own little world, and you&rsquo;re not allowed in. It&rsquo;s like electric Soma- an opiate for people who want a certain degree of withdrawal from the outside world. Well I have news: life wasn&rsquo;t meant to come with a soundtrack and adding one just makes it all the more traumatic when your batteries die.</p>
            <p>Yet, the Ipod craze does serve to bring to the surface an interesting realization. In the past few decades, the world has become more interconnected than ever. Yet paradoxically, people have become more withdrawn. More modes of instantaneous transmission exist today than could have possibly been imagined 100 years ago. AIM, Cell Phones, Text Messages, Email, Fax, Streaming Music/Video, Powerpoint and a half a dozen others. We are constantly bombarded with a litany of data from every direction in the world around us.</p>
            <p> What is our response? Like an autistic child, we withdraw into our own cocoon. We lose ourselves in our Ipod song lists, we hide behind AIM screens, we hole up in our geared out islands of Sharper Image electronics and Ikea self-assembly furniture. We slowly lose the ability to communicate with other human beings as human beings. We have begun the gradual problem of dehumanization. In what is perhaps the greatest irony of our times, our own connectivity is becoming our greatest barrier towards connecting with other human beings on a meaningful level. </p>
            <p>What has changed? The human beings of today have been trained by immersion to receive and process information<br>
              at a rate that would put a man of 500 years ago in a seizure. Can you imagine how Rene Descartes would react if told to communicate via AIM with 7 people, answer a cell phone call, check email and write a report all while listening to Friends reruns in the background? I give him 30 seconds before he starts twitching. Yet our friend Mr. Descartes was able to uncover some of the greatest philosophical and mathematical insights of his age. Cogito ergo Sum, I think, therefore I am. Remember this point, I&rsquo;ll be returning to it later.</p>
            <p>In our rush to take everything in, our ability to examine information in excruciatingly precise detail has been diminished. There are exceptions to this- brilliant mathematicians and theologians still pour over formulas and sacred texts trying to extract every ounce of meaning from every letter and comma. The scholar of today looks in awe at the Rabbis that produced and committed to memory 64 tractates and 8000 pages of sacred text. Yet what he fails to recognize is that the scholar of two thousand years ago had to brave tempest and storm and great sojourn to find new sources. The speed at which information was delivered to him was a crawl compared to the pace of even 200 years ago. He had no choice but to extract every bit of meaning he could from every letter, every breath, and every experience. When the faucet runs at a trickle, you treasure every drop.</p>
            <p>This leads me to my key insight. With an increase in the quantity of information we are confronted with in our daily lives, we have seen a commensurate decrease in the quality of information. Its not just a function of media- its a natural bi-product of our age. The more layers of crap you have to dig through to find life&rsquo;s truth, the more ambiguous your language. Abraham Lincoln was able to convey in 13 sentences a sentiment that few politicians could today convey in 80 minutes. The human brain, we have discovered, functions much like a low band-pass filter: losing intensity of output with a commensurate increase in frequency of input. </p>
            <p>In the sea of information, our ability to think and act clearly and intelligently is being atrophied. It is simply impossible for our flailing minds to stay afloat in the rapids of information we are forced to swim through everyday. So we choose not to swim. We choose not to think, not to question. We take a Soma and drift off into oblivion. In doing so, we lose track of who we are. A certain degree of withdrawal from time to time is healthy; the human brain cannot be redlined constantly, it has its limits. What worries me is the fact that this withdrawal has become a pervasive and persistent phenomenon. It has become not only convenient, but also socially acceptable for us to do so. We have sacrificed our desire to think and traded it for a Soma with headphones. </p>
            <p>I have always been resistant to change. Growing up in a blue-collar family, I never got the latest gadgets until they were practically pervasive. I didn&rsquo;t have Internet access until nearly my junior year of high school. I didn&rsquo;t get a cell phone until my sophomore year of college. I have always been resistant to the pervasiveness of technology into my life. As of late I have begun to wonder who is really the slave or master, my cell phone or myself? This has become a question that is much tougher to answer with each passing day. </p>
            <p>In his seminole 1974 work <em>Future Shock</em>, Alvin Toffler expressed many of my same concerns. Toffler predicted widespread nervous breakdown would cause people to flee to live in caves in remote locales, which while not literally accurate, may partly describe the place many of us seem to travel to whenever we press play on our Ipod. Our capacity for the here and now is diminished in an effort to partly escape from a world to rapidly approaching. We don&rsquo;t face life, we merely run away from it for a time.</p>
            <p>What do I suggest? A return to Homo Cogitus. Leave behind your I-pod and try thinking when you are walking from Point A to Point B. Or maybe open your eyes and ears to the world around you. I&rsquo;m sure you will find it much less convoluted without the latest Modest Mouse single reverberating your skull with 85 db of intensity. Only by returning to reality and rejecting that which seeks to insulate us from it can we truly begin to think and thereby understand who we really are. Cogito ergo sum is a one-way street and without thought and introspection we lose the capacity to understand ourselves.</p>
            <p>In this regard, I think the Jewish religion may have the right idea: a sabbath, a day of rest. For a person constantly swimming in a pool of information and toil, nothing is more liberating than to insulate and remove yourself from it. To derive worth from being, thinking and experience with your own senses rather than electronic ones. A return to whom we are, to introspect, examine and think. While perhaps the literal interpretation of Orthodoxy is not for everyone, a great deal can be learned from its underlying lesson- slow down and let life catch up with you from time to time. </p>
            <p>So what I am suggesting is this- pull the plug. Disconnect your Ipod; throw it away. Next time someone calls you and you have something more tangible in front of you, let it go to voicemail. Go for a walk and watch children playing in the park, rather than sitting around checking your email. Leave behind the biology book when you ride the treadmill; use the time instead to clear your head. Let your mind catch up with the world around you. I guarantee that you will hate it at first. But eventually, you&rsquo;ll thank God you did it. Then, you&rsquo;ll hear life&rsquo;s soundtrack. Not your Ipod&rsquo;s.</p>
