            <p>The recent release of results from an investigation into the United Nation&rsquo;s Oil for Food Program (OFFP) in Iraq and the ramifications of a sex scandal involving peacekeepers in the Congo reaffirm that the Bush administration acted rationally in transgressing the UN in order to effectively manage the threat of Saddam Hussein.</p>
            <p>Through its investigation, the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil for Food Program (IIC), found &ldquo;shortcomings in management and control procedures, violations of UN procedures, verifiable monetary losses, agreements to implement recommendations that were chronically violated, and other serious irregularities&rdquo; in the OFFP. The report criticizing the OFFP, released January 9, details auditing errors that are reminiscent of the Enron and Arthur Andersen disaster. In mid-November 2004, the United States Senate&rsquo;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations<br>
              estimated that Saddam Hussein illegally earned upwards of 21 billion dollars through the OFFP&mdash;supposedly under the scrutiny of the UN.</p>
            <p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan created the IIC in April 2004 to examine various allegations concerning the OFFP. Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, heads the committee. Although funded and initiated by the UN, the IIC acts as an independent organization.</p>
            <p>The UN created Iraq&rsquo;s OFFP to offset the humanitarian problems caused by Gulf War economic sanctions. The program allowed Iraq to export its oil in exchange for food, medicine, and other essential humanitarian goods. The UN resolution creating the OFFP, adopted in April 1995, also provided for ensuring &ldquo;the transparency of each transaction&rdquo;. </p>
            <p>The UN failed to enforce this provision. As the Senate and IIC investigations demonstrate, the UN put little effort into auditing the Iraqi oil dealings. The IIC report explicitly states, &ldquo;oil contracts were not examined with an eye to the enforcement of contract requirements, despite the fact that UN officials had contract-approval responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Saddam Hussein clearly took advantage of the UN&rsquo;s inability to enforce its measures. In what the IIC report refers to as &ldquo;the Iraqi government&rsquo;s kickback scheme,&rdquo; Hussein would tack on surcharge fees to OFFP business transactions.<br>
              Companies would compensate for the surcharge by overpricing the goods or delivering substandard products. Hussein also milked the other side of Iraq&rsquo;s business, selling oil at reduced prices in exchange for a company accepting a significant surcharge. Saddam, it is believed, used much of this money for weapons production. Weapons that, as Joy Gordon of <em>The Nation</em> acknowledges, &ldquo;went to terrorists around the world, not to mention (rather astonishingly) the post-Saddam insurgency.&rdquo; It is partly because of UN indolence that a band of sufficiently armed rebels continues to endanger US troops.</p>
            <p>Hussein&rsquo;s regime also used the OFFP for political influence. With little foresight, the UN resolution gave Saddam and his Iraqi regime the power to arrange contracts. Exploiting this, Saddam frequently gave OFFP oil vouchers in exchange for lobbying on behalf of Iraq on important issues. The most public and notorious case involved Samir Vincent, an Iraqi-American who pleaded guilty on January 19 to fraud and posing as a US government agent. According to a CIA report from October 2004, Vincent received 7.9 million barrels of oil from Iraq through the OFFP&mdash;allotments that later reaped him a profit of $3.6 million. In exchange for the oil allotments, Vincent lobbied for pro-Iraq causes in the United States. He also had a significant role in the initial creation of the OFFP. In his plea agreement, Vincent acknowledged the existence of an actual UN official that received a significant amount of money from Hussein. </p>
            <p>Other allegations of UN affiliates taking part in Saddam&rsquo;s kickback scheme also exist. US officials are even investigating a possible link with Kojo Annan, Kofi Annan&rsquo;s son. In the past Kojo did business with Cotecna, the Swiss company that the UN hired to help audit Iraq&rsquo;s imports. According to a statement released by Senator Norm Coleman, chairman of the subcommittee investigating the OFFP, &ldquo;the U.N. recently admitted that Kojo Annan received more money [from Cotecna] than previously disclosed&hellip;[and that] there are growing, albeit unproven, allegations that Kofi Annan himself not only understands his son&rsquo;s role in this scandal&mdash;but that he has been less than forthcoming in what he knew, and when he knew it.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>The UN&rsquo;s Iraqi OFFP proved totally ineffective&mdash;mainly from lack of enforcement. Saddam prospered, built weapons, and manipulated UN politicians in result. Without the US-led coalition&rsquo;s ousting of Saddam, one can only fret over the consequences. </p>
            <p>Remarkably, the UN cannot enforce provisions on itself either. UN peacekeeping soldiers in the Congo have perpetuated a despicably significant number of rapes on Congolese girls. A January 5 UN report detailed 68 allegations of sexual exploitation concerning UN military personnel&mdash;all taking place in a single town. Due to various circumstances, however, only six cases were investigated and substantiated by the UN. </p>
            <p>Most of the victims were under the age of 18. The report relates a story of one 14 year-old girl, in which &ldquo;each time [the] soldier gave her $1 or $2 or two eggs in return [for sex].&rdquo; According to the <em>Times of London</em>, mayonnaise and jam were other methods of payment. The Times also reported that an international organization recorded over 140 local pregnancies caused by Moroccan or Uruguayan UN soldiers. Basically, things are out of control. </p>
            <p>The integrity of the UN and Kofi Annan is certainly at stake. Events on the same scope and magnitude of Enron and Abu Ghraib are continuing to unfold. Meanwhile, a large proportion of Americans still believe that the country should have used the UN to address the risk of Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime. Undoubtedly&mdash;without the US coalition&rsquo;s sidestepping of the UN&mdash;Saddam would still be enjoying kickbacks form the Iraqi OFFP. Perhaps he would have reached his funding goal for a new nuclear centrifuge this coming spring. Nobody will ever know. There is no place in this world for a diplomatic body that will not enforce its own regulations. The dangers of inaction are far too great.</p>
