            <p>Typical of a healthy, democratic system the opposing political viewpoints of Republicans and Democrats over the war in Iraq continue to widen the aisle between the right and left. Democrats continue to address the war in Iraq with skepticism, some even denigrating the war, while Republicans continue to support their Commander in Chief in &ldquo;staying the course.&rdquo; I have always been a supporter of political discourse and opposing viewpoints, but the continuing divergence in our political leadership over the war in Iraq may be making it difficult to win the peace in this war torn nation.</p>
            <p>Our nation needs political unity to win the peace in Iraq; to help Iraq rebuild its economic infrastructure; to help Iraq create a democratic government; to help Iraq achieve its potential of becoming a self-sufficient, stable, secure, and prosperous nation. How can the United States lead the War on Terror and win the peace in Iraq, unless the political parties within this nation reach a consensus on how to stop the insurgencies? The Bush Administration continues to make some vital mistakes in its strategy to win the peace in Iraq. At the same time, the demands that some Democratic leaders make in their political attacks against the Administration would cause some major difficulties in stopping the ongoing insurgencies and winning the peace. Republicans and Democrats must take a step across the aisle, shake hands, and reach a consensus on US strategy in Iraq. </p>
            <p>Iraqis experienced a historic moment on Sunday with the election of a transitional national assembly. Everyone saw the tears of jubilation as millions of Iraqis exited the polls and raised their ink-stained fingers. This was a momentous event for Iraq&rsquo;s goals: establishing a democratic government and creating a stable, secure, and prosperous nation. Larry Diamond, who served as a senior advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority, spoke at Stanford on Monday and expressed his view that the elections in Iraq were a huge step forward for democracy in Iraq, and a great moral defeat for the terrorists. However, he made clear that this was only a step, and that other steps are needed to further the democratic process and to establish a foundation for security and prosperity. </p>
            <p>Seeing the voter turnout rates in Iraq being between 60-70% made me cautiously optimistic that Iraq can achieve stability through the formation of a functional democracy. On the downside, we must realize that the low voter turnout rates of Iraqi Sunnis (somewhere around 30%) will make it problematic to end the insurgency. A large part of the insurgency in Iraq is lead by Iraqi Sunnis. It is vital to bring these Sunnis back into the political process in order to stop the insurgency. As Larry Diamond articulated, &ldquo;Steps need to be taken to separate the Sunni insurgents from the jihadist terrorists and, in turn, widen the political arena and stifle support for the insurgency in Iraq.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Sunni participation and support for the political process is also needed for a permanent Iraqi Constitution to be ratified. The 275-member Iraqi parliament that was just elected will have four functions: selecting a three-person presidency council, selecting a prime minister, passing a budget, and drafting a permanent constitution. Once the permanent constitution is written it will go to a referendum. Each province will have the opportunity to vote on this permanent constitution. If the constitution is approved by a majority vote in each province then it will become permanent and a permanent government will be elected, but if three provinces veto the constitution by a 2/3 vote then the drafting process will start over. This is problematic because there are three provinces that are predominantly Sunni. There are also three that are predominantly Kurdish. Most of the Sunni political leaders boycotted the recent election, and if they are not convinced to reenter the political process then it will be very difficult to pass a permanent constitution.</p>
            <p>One of the mistakes by President Bush, which Larry Diamond emphasized in his speech on Monday, is that the Administration continues to signal an intent to establish permanent military bases in Iraq. The President refuses to declare that the United States has no intentions or designs for permanent military bases in Iraq. This is proving to be an obstruction during the formation of democracy in Iraq. There are many Iraqis that do not want American troops in Iraq; this sentiment is especially strong in the Sunni camp. Larry Diamond said that many of them feel ashamed and insulted by having foreign troops on their soil, but at the same time they know that they need the American troops right now because they cannot provide for their own security and stability. I think most Americans would say that they only want our troops to be there as long as it takes to create a free, secure, and stable governing system. Then why does the Bush Administration not declare that they have no intentions to establish permanent military bases in Iraq? Maybe it is because they are worried about the state of American military bases in Saudi Arabia. Whatever the reason, the Bush Administration needs to change their stance on this issue. It is vital that the Bush Administration declare that they have no designs or intentions for permanent military bases in Iraq, so that the table can be set for negotiations to bring the Sunnis back into the political process.</p>
            <p>While, the Bush Administration refuses to clarify their stance on permanent military bases in Iraq, Democrats insist that the President make certain changes to his strategy in Iraq. Many of these demands would be devastating to the situation in Iraq and would only further the motivations of the insurgency. On January 31st Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid made a statement calling on President Bush to outline an exit strategy in Iraq. No! The United States cannot signal an intent to withdraw its troops now because that would give the insurgents hope that they can achieve their goals in Iraq. This would give the insurgents motivation to continue their efforts, it would negate all the messages that the coalition has sent them that they cannot and will not win in Iraq. </p>
            <p>Our strategy thus far has signaled to the insurgents that an Iraqi democratic government will be formed, and their best option is to join this political process. The Bush Administration has made it clear that if the new Iraqi government asks us to leave, then American troops will leave Iraq. But the Iraqi government doesn&rsquo;t want us to leave (yet) because they know that if we do, Iraq will fall into a state of civil war. The Iraqi Army is not yet capable of stifling the insurgency lead by Sunnis and jihadist terrorists.Withdrawing now would destroy all of the progress that has been made so far. </p>
            <p>Withdrawing now would destroy the huge step forward that was made on Sunday with the elections in Iraq. Withdrawing now would give the insurgents and terrorists hope. Withdrawing now would put more pressure on the American, coalition, and Iraqi troops that remain in Iraq. Withdrawing now would probably cause Iraq to fall into a state of civil war.</p>
            <p>President Bush, for the sake of our troops and the future of Iraq, I beg you to make a statement that the United States has no intentions or designs for permanent military bases in Iraq. Give the Sunnis a reason to join the political process. Show them that rejoining the democratic process is their best option, their only option. Senator Kennedy and Senator Reid, for the sake of our troops and the future of Iraq, for once in your life stand behind your Commander in Chief on the other side of the aisle. Don&rsquo;t make this a political debate. The lives of American troops, Iraqis, and ultimately the American people are at stake here. If Iraq becomes a failed state, a safe haven and training grounds for terrorists, the security of the United States will be at greater risk.</p>
            <p>After listening to President Bush&rsquo;s State of the Union Address and the Democratic joint response by Senator Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi it is obvious that Republicans and Democrats both have many of the same goals. The only difference is that the right and the left in the American political system have different views on how to achieve these goals. Republicans and Democrats both want to see the spread of democracy throughout the world. Both parties also want to see Iraq become a stable, secure, and prosperous nation. Both parties also want to see our troops come home as soon as possible. We are at a crossroads in the history of our nation and of the world, and it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats stand together and leave party politics aside so that Iraq can establish a legitimate democracy, put down the insurgency, and secure its borders. When this happens, our troops can come home, and the United States will have gained a new friend and a new ally in the nation of Iraq.</p>
