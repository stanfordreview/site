          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p>On Monday, October 25th<em> The Stanford Review</em> had the privilege of sponsoring an event with Aman Verjee, Alec Rawls and Eric Jackson, all contributors to the book <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>; an anthology about President Bush published by World Ahead Publishing. CSPAN covered the event for its book television program and aired it on Monday November 1st.</p>
            <p>Stanford Republicans President Bob Sensenbrenner opened the event giving a warm welcome to the audience while touching on the major themes of the book, which includes contributions by over 20 conservative luminaries including Vice President Cheney, Attorney General John Ashcroft, James Dobson, Rod Martin and many others. He also touched on the relationship between the Stanford Review and the Stanford Republicans and their importance in representing the marginalized minority conservative voice at Stanford. Sensenbrenner highlighted Stanford Republicans&rsquo; founder Michael New&rsquo;s contribution to the book.</p>
            <p>Next to speak was Eric Jackson, who made an extremely detailed and elaborate case for why President Bush should be elected. He spoke of the President&rsquo;s resolute leadership in the war on terror and the risks of electing the much less aggressive John Kerry. Jackson spoke of Bush as, &ldquo;a compassionate man who loves the people of his country and the world.&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s speech highlighted the true importance of the presidential election on the formation of the world by painting a picture of two very differ-ent scenarios. He detailed how America could possibly be more exposed under a Kerry presidency.</p>
            <p>Aman Verjee, Editor of <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>, was the keynote speaker of the event, and his speech focused on the economy. Verjee first asked the audience to recount the history of taxing and tax rates. He pointed to the 70% level under Jimmy Carter as a huge impairment on the economy. He then built a very powerful argument that the Bush tax cuts were vital for continued economic expansion. Verjee continued in the question and answer session, saying that judgment on the President&rsquo;s decisions would likely occur 50 years in the future.</p>
            <p>The third and final speaker was Alec Rawls, whose contribution to the book was a detailed and logical opposition to the Kyoto Treaty and support of the President&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;unsign&rdquo; the bill. Rawls detailed the economic devastation that would have occured had America agreed to follow the treaty as well as its failure to take into account a cost-benefit analysis. Rawls also spoke to the absurdity of the Democrats pro-tecting 2,000 acres of huge oil supplies in Alaska from drilling . He highlighted how the decision not to tap this natural resource shows how environmentalists are willing to give up quality of life for conservation at all costs. Rawls displayed the impressive research he has personally undertaken on the topic.</p>
            <p>While a Stanford Political Science Department debate typically draws about 200 students, this event drew approximately 50 people and will, more importantly, be seen by over 100,000 people on national television, making it the largest and most widely seen political activity at Stanford this year. The event served as a great opportunity for the conservative voice at Stanford to increase its strength and receive national press coverage.</p>
          <p><em>Thank You, President Bush </em>is the first release for the Gardena, CA based World Ahead Publishing, which was founded by Eric Jackson in early 2004 as a response to the lack of high quality conservative publications on the book market today. Eric Jackson is a former<em> Stanford Review </em>Editor.</p></td>
