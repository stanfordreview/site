          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p>This summer I had the pleasure of attending the Vans Warped Tour in San Francisco. The tour brings together extreme sports and punk bands from across the country every summer for a day-long music and culture festival. I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to attend the last 5 Warped Tours, but I noticed that this year&rsquo;s atmosphere was distinctly different from tours of the past. When I was 13, I remember politics as being a peripheral focus of the event. I was somewhat interested in politics at that point. I may have even been seen wearing an &ldquo;Anti-Flag&rdquo; t-shirt, but I don&rsquo;t recall anything that paralleled the sort of constant political bombardment that took place at this summer&rsquo;s tour. I ultimately left the concert early, angry and disheveled at the arrogance, ignorance and hypocrisy of what I saw.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I have merely matured since my younger days. I can no longer blame America and the government for everything that goes wrong in my life. I recognize that the issues of our time are not as simple as stereotypical labels perpetuated by Warped Tour bands. If I had a pound of salmon for every time I heard about &ldquo;corporate greed&rdquo; and &ldquo;media conglomerations&rdquo; I would&hellip; well, have a lot of salmon. Now, I will be the first to concede that there are issues with the power structure in our society that need to be addressed. What struck me, though, was the extremism, the exaggeration and theatrical effect that these bands generated. The politics I encountered was IN YOUR FACE, ROCK AND ROLL, PUNK AND PISSED, and also incredibly moronic. Let me explain&hellip;</p>
            <p>I got to the concert at about twelve o&rsquo;clock. Before even entering the venue, the first thing I noticed was the apparent age of the audience. I would say the average &ldquo;punk&rdquo; these days is a 16 or 17 year old, most likely from a relatively wealthy urban or suburban area. His or her wardrobe is comprised mostly of black and red clothing, studded belts and chains. I suppose I was expecting an audience that was more closely aligned with the original ideals of punk. That is, individuality and self expression. Dress punk, dress prep, dress whatever&hellip; I don&rsquo;t care. What I saw, though, was a mob of people that looked like they all shop at Hot Topic.</p>
            <p>Now, we all know that punk is dead. My experience this summer proved to me that individualism has died as well. What irritates me is that punk rock appears to have become a tool to indoc-trinate the uninformed with a political ideology. Along with the black clothes and patches came an almost mandatory inflammatory political message. Various slogans such as &ldquo;fuck the government&rdquo; and &ldquo;fuck Bush&rdquo; were rampant. My personal favorite was a t-shirt that declares that George Bush was &ldquo;Not my President.&rdquo; One might conclude that hating our president has been successfully coupled with rebellion. I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder whether the apparent hatred was really founded on personal beliefs and ideology or merely the latest accessory from Teen People.</p>
            <p>I had a great time enjoying the music as I observed the various political slogans on t-shirts. I chuckled at the absurdity of some while wincing at the utter stupidity of others, all the while keeping my cool. That is, until Anti-flag took the main stage. Anti-flag made their presence (and credibility) entirely clear by beginning their set with a string of profanity reminiscent of a drunken sailor. In my view, the band essentially opposes everything that has generated the wealth to pro-vide the best life-style in the world that we currently enjoy in America. They apparently oppose capitalism, the American Flag, any form of government, Locke&rsquo;s conception of property and the social contract and judging from the inherent consequences of their ideology, would like to go back to living in mud huts eating tree bark and snails. In short, they appear to oppose everything about western civilization.</p>
            <p>Not surprisingly, in all their talk of the corporate elite, they seem to have found quite a following. Thousands of &ldquo;angry punks&rdquo; stampeded around the pier chanting intelligent slogans such as &ldquo;fuck corporate America.&rdquo; Yup, screw the corporations that give people jobs to pay for these concerts. Screw the corporations that generated the wealth that created this pier in the first place. Screw the corporations that own the very tour you are taking part in. Screw the corporation that produced and distributed the cds you make. Yeah, screw it.</p>
            <p>So who are the people motivat-ing political angst among our youth? PunkVoter.com is an organization founded by Mike Burkett, lead singer of NOFX, in order to &ldquo;educate today&rsquo;s youth about what is really going on in Washington.&rdquo; Gee Mike, I&rsquo;m sure glad that our youth have you to educate them about the intricacies of American foreign and domestic policy. After all, you&rsquo;ve been responsible for such profound compositions as &ldquo;Kill All the White Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;Please Stop Fuck-ing My Mom.&rdquo; Beyond the hilarity of Fat Mike&rsquo;s attempt to contribute something to the intellectual debate of our country is the blatant hypocrisy behind these bands.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s no secret that the Van&rsquo;s Warped Tour attempts to bill itself as an &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; event. The same is true with the ESPN X-Games, MTV and Hot Topic. So it is no surprise that bands often reflect a similar attitude in their songs. The irony is that, simply by being a well known &ldquo;anti-establish-ment&rdquo; band they have undermined the primary plank of their dissent. You think NOFX really gives a shit about corporate America? They ARE corporate America and they are tak-ing their &ldquo;anti-establishment&rdquo; attitude straight to the bank. Skipping over to anti-flag.com I was promptly greeted by a teaser to buy their latest DVD. Hmm&hellip; they couldn&rsquo;t possibly be asking me to BUY their DVD, could they? You mean the DVD produced by a evil corporation, prices set by a free market, the proceeds from which you will use to pay for your shoes made in China and guitars made in Mexico? No&hellip; you couldn&rsquo;t possibly be asking that. You&rsquo;d rather have the government tax the living hell out of its citizens in the name of &ldquo;equality.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It boils down to this: these bands and tours are selling an image. Every time Fat Mike compares Bush to Hitler he sells five more shirts at the NOFX tent. It&rsquo;s a brilliant marketing tactic, but it&rsquo;s an intellectually bankrupt ide-ology. These people could just move to Sweden and live out their socialist utopia, but they don&rsquo;t. Why not? Because they know that America is the only place on the face of the Earth that will give them lots of money for being a radical nut-ball. How many punk bands do you think there are in North Korea? It&rsquo;s a product of our (traditional) liberal society that these far-left bozos even exist!</p>
            <p>That&rsquo;s not to say the consumer isn&rsquo;t at fault either. The idiots who buy into the image are just as guilty as the bands themselves. Take off your shoes and look at the tag. Go on&hellip; I dare you. Ten bucks says they were made in China, Indonesia or Korea. If your reaction is &ldquo;this is the product of an inevitable trend of globalization and free market prices&rdquo; then congratulations, you are a rational thinker. If your reaction is &ldquo;sweet jibbidy jippers, sweatshops of death, lets tax the evil corporate America,&rdquo; then feel free to move to Cuba. I honestly can&rsquo;t believe there are still people who believe Marx. I&rsquo;ll just say it now. If you think that socialism will solve our problems, you&rsquo;re an idiot. Sure enough, I encountered several individuals more than happy to enlighten me on the brilliance of Karl Marx. In the back of my head, I kept thinking &ldquo;what the hell is wrong with these people?&rdquo; You live the best lifestyle in the richest part of the richest nation on the face of the earth!</p>
            <p>Now, I realize not all liberals are on the same page as Marx. There are different degrees of liberal dementia. But, then it hit me: there is a thread joining all of these people together: Anger. Anger at mom. Anger at girlfriend. Anger at the imperfection in the world. And, perhaps, anger that they are the protectors of a failed ideology. So they bitch and moan about everything. They misinform or bend facts, support a socialist or communist form of government and remain unproductive leeches on our great society. In short, they are true to the unofficial slogan of communism; they truly are &ldquo;fighting inequality by making everyone miserable equally.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>So where am I going with all this? I&rsquo;d like a more intelligent debate in our country. I&rsquo;d like more people to recognize people like Mike Burkett and the folks at punkvoter.com for the partisan hacks they are. It&rsquo;s good that PunkVoter.com seeks to register new voters, but they are missing the other key aspect of a healthy democracy: an educated electorate. By coupling entertainment with politics, they do our country a disservice by registering voters that do not possess the fundamental knowledge that is necessary to be an informed voter. It&rsquo;s about time we enact some laws that prevent partisan voter registration organizations like PunkVoter.com from operating.</p></td>
