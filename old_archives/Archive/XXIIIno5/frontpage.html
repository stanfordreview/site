<img src="http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/XXIIIno5/images/forbes.jpg" width=244 height=204 alternate="Steve Forbes" align=left>	Last Wednesday, November 10th, Steve Forbes presented his first major policy speech in Silicon Valley, outlining his plans to keep Washington far away from high technology. <p>

	Mr. Forbes spoke at the Santa Clara Marriott, in a room large enough to easily serve a hundred people.  The luncheon, organized by the Churchill Club, normally involves either a technology theorist like George Gilder or a high-profile CEO like Sun Microsystems's Scott McNealy.  Even President Clinton sought and found an audience at this locus of Silicon Valley success.  The attendance cut a cross-section of high-tech, composed of venture capitalists, computer consultants, Internet startups, and a small group of Stanford students organized at the last minute by the Forbes campaign.<p>

	Yet, despite the refined setting and the high expectations, the reality was something less than perfect.  The huge room looked only half-filled.  Many of the tables that were occupied had empty spaces, though every seat had its chicken sandwich and cheesecake.  One wonders whether it was the Churchill Club or Mr. Forbes who paid to load the empty tables down with food just in case.  The introduction and speech began twenty minutes after the scheduled time.  Mr. Forbes's introductory ad libs fell flat, and the beginning of his speech, a parade of statistics designed to demonstrate the wonders of high technology, sounded painfully stiff.<p>

	Given the nature of the Valley, it's not surprising that Mr. Forbes skipped the socially conservative themes that have been a hallmark of this year's candidacy.  Instead he gave a seven-step program for making sure high-tech can continue to grow as it has in the '90s.  Mr. Forbes is an unabashed free-marketeer Ð no Clintonian "public-private partnerships" for him.  His seven steps were all ways to get and keep the government out of Silicon Valley.<p>

	"Now it is time to remove the big government barriers that stand in our way so we can expand e-commerce and help every American take full advantage of the Information Age," he said.<p>

	As he warmed up, moving away from his rehearsed beginning, it became clear that Mr. Forbes cared about what he said.  He spoke clearly and naturally, seeming almost spontaneous.  And he picked his topics well for his audience.  Unplanned applause interrupted his speech when he proposed "abolishing" the capital gains tax.  Step number three, changing an obscure accounting rule about asset expensing, had heads nodding in the wake of government lawsuits against several high-tech companies' interpretations of that rule.<p>

	Mr. Forbes's ideas seemed to strike a chord in the room, sending smiles and nods of agreement through the audience.  Some of them are standard fare - providing school vouchers and tort reform are centerpieces of Republican thinking on the economy, while expanding skilled immigration and ending the capital gains tax make the short version of Silicon Valley's wish-list.  But other ideas, like expanding NAFTA to include Great Britain, Ireland, and Japan, are honestly bold, and, given that Mr. Forbes must play to the same conservative voters as Pat Buchanan, risky as well.<p>

	As soon as he had abandoned his set speech during the question and answer period, Forbes visibly relaxed.  As he answered softball questions on taxes, he cracked jokes at the expense of George W. Bush and Donald Trump, showed concern for African-Americans and the poor, and again demonstrated his grasp of free-market economics.  But when the questions veered away from taxes to "What about the children?", Mr. Forbes dodged them, preferring instead to discuss how his tax cuts would generate more revenue.<p>

	After the luncheon, Mr. Forbes stayed for but a few minutes before rushing to his next appointment -- no working the crowd, no canvassing for donations.  He seemed less like a candidate and more like a normal speaker for the Churchill Club: a high-tech visionary with more important things to do than begging for money or votes.<p>

	There's no question that Mr. Forbes should have natural supporters in Silicon Valley.  He edits the nation's leading business magazine, after all, one that puts a computer-industry entrepreneur on its cover every other month.  His online campaign began earlier and harder than any other candidate's did.   His Internet operation works so smoothly that the story of his speech was online four hours before the speech was actually given.<p>

	The actual extent of his support is hard to determine, however.  Rumors say that Silicon Valley is already organized for George W. Bush, Bill Bradley, and Al Gore.  Nor is it hard to see why.  The conversation afterwards spent some time praising his ideas, but quickly moved to the impossibility of his election.  His platform seemed to encompass all of the good economic ideas Republicans have had in the last few years.  But despite the millions he has spent trying to attract support and the coherence of his ideas, Mr. Forbes runs a distant second to George W. Bush.  Mr. Forbes will learn the hard way that ideas and money don't  always win out over the art of political shmoozing.
