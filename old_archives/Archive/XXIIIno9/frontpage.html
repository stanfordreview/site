<a name=frontpage1></a><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+3>Proposition 21: Juvenile Crime<br></font><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+1><i>For Proposition 21<br></i></font>"Prevention and Punishment" is the most popular slogan about juvenile crime. It is the method politicians preach when interrogated by the press, and for once it is the method the government ought to follow. <p>
Unfortunately, many left-leaning activists do not realize that the key word in the slogan is "and". In their opposition to Proposition 21, which California voters will see on their ballots in the March election, liberals would like to believe that the nation's juvenile crime problem can be solved by prevention alone.<p>
Proposition 21 is designed to crackdown on the most violent youth offenders. The most notable aspect of the bill is that, if passed, it would allow some juveniles to be tried as adults in court. The opposition to the bill centers primarily around the notion that it treats juveniles too harshly and that it would cost too much money  - it would cost taxpayers an estimated $1 billion. Among other things, that money would go towards building a new prison facility.<p>
In preaching out against the bill because it is too hard on youth, liberals make the mistake of adopting an all-or-nothing mentality. To understand, consider the case of 14 - year old Thomas Preciado, who was convicted of killing a liquor store owner for a mere $50. Now judges face the decision of whether to try him as a juvenile or as an adult. To protest an adult trial, the community adopted the slogan: "Thomas Is Not a Monster - He is a 14-year-old Child." <p>
The community is only half-correct. Thomas need not be branded a monster. There is the possibility that he will  be rehabilitated, released, and allowed to lead a quasi-normal life, without posing a threat to society. However, we must consider whether it is appropriate to consider him just a "child." If a 14-year-old is precocious enough to commit murder, then he should be precocious enough to stand trial as an adult. He still may be rehabilitated, but he perhaps ought to stay in jail past his eighteenth birthday.<p>
As ex-Governor Pete Wilson and other proponents of the legislation aptly note, "the purpose of the bill is to get the most violent offenders into adult court." The Bill would not put 10-year-olds who shoplift into adult court. It is directed towards gangs and other extremely dangerous youth, such as Thomas Preciado. <p>
Consider an 11-year-old in Michigan who committed murder. If he is tried as a juvenile, he will necessarily be released when he is 18. Again opponents of his trial as an adult insist that he must be allowed to rehabilitate himself. But the state, in this case Michigan, must realize that the boy is neither a "monster" nor a "child" but something in between: a disturbed youth with extremely dangerous and violent tendencies. He may indeed be able to rehabilitate himself, but it also may take a good deal longer than 7 years.<p>
Ralph Miller, president of the Deputy Probation Officers Union, opposes Proposition 21. He says, "Most juveniles do rehabilitate." What he doesn't recognize is that the bill targets the youth who are least likely to rehabilitate themselves. <p>
Miller also claims that is an inappropriate expenditure of state funds. "The money can be better spent on early prevention and education," says Miller. Thus, he too commits the critical logical fallacy. Prevention is only half the solution. More money should also be spent on prevention and education, but that money must not come from the funds for punishment. California should certainly try to educate all youth and prevent them from committing crimes. But in the meantime, it needs to deal with the youth who do become criminals.<p>
If for no other reason, California voters ought to support Proposition 21 on mere conservative principle. Jesse Jackson opposes it—it must be valuable.<p>

<a name=frontpage2></a><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+3>Proposition 21: Juvenile Crime<br></font><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+1><i>Against Proposition 21<br></i></font>No one denies that too many crimes are being committed, especially by minors, and the statistics show that proposition 21 will make that worse.  Is a fourteen year old who has reached the point of committing murder really thinking logically about the consequences?  Is it really plausible, as 21's defenders claim, that a fourteen-year-old child will think to him or herself, "Well, if I were only going to go to jail for ten years I would kill this person, but since it will be for longer I won't."?  People who carry out violent crimes are not thinking about the consequences; this is even more true with the children this initiative would apply to.  If ten years, as long as many of this law's victims are able to remember, is not a deterrent, another few won't make any difference.<p>
Even worse than not preventing crimes, proposition 21 will turn around and cause more of them.  Juvenile offenders placed in adult prisons are more likely to commit crimes afterwards than those tried as juveniles.  By placing children into the adult system without any sort of judicial review to determine their suitability, we will greatly increase the number of crimes they commit later on in life.  Currently, children of fourteen years can and are tried as adults when a court determines it to be appropriate; this proposition would replace intelligent oversight with a cookie-cutter approach which treats every child the same way.  Yes, in many cases it is appropriate to sentence juveniles in adult courts, but it is a mistake to do it without allowing personal oversight to make sure that it is the best decision in each case.<p>
Proposition 21 is focused not on preventing crime, but on taking revenge on youths who commit crimes.  It flies directly in the face of the evidence, increasing crime just so children can be put in jail for longer.  The criminal justice system should not be about punishing people but about avoiding future crimes.  Jail sentences are supposed to deter potential criminals; the expanded sentences from this proposition will not do that.  Instead taxpayers will pay billions just to enact a petty vengeance on these youths.  They may be criminals, but they are also children.<p>
The key effects of proposition 21 are the following: take children barely into high school, utterly unprepared to make life altering decisions, treat them like adults even though it has no deterrent effect, put them in adult prisons where there is a record of abuse of children, and increase the crime rate.  Oh yes, and cost more than one billion dollars in the first year alone.  There is a problem to be solved, but proposition 21 is not the way to do it.<p>

<a name=frontpage3></a><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+3>Proposition 22: Gay Marriage<br></font><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+1><i>Against Proposition 22<br></i></font>The bill intends to protect the institution of marriage by allowing California to ignore gay marriages permitted in other states, but, actually, voting against 22 is a conservative statement in favor of preserving the central and protected status of marriage in our society.<p>
Most large companies and universities already grant benefits to "domestic partners."  Some government agencies, including a number of towns and cities around the country, are beginning to do so as well.  This creates the perverse situation where it is easier for gay couples to get partner benefits than it is for straight couples.  Because there is no way to distinguish homosexuals who have just moved in together after dating for a month from those who have been living like a married couple for ten years, organizations which give privileges to some gay partners are forced to give them to all gay partners.<p>
Once any homosexual partner, regardless of commitment or the length of the relationship, is granted the same benefits as a spouse, organizations are being slowly pressured to apply the same principles to straight couples.  Sex-discrimination laws make it difficult for companies to grant domestic-partner benefits to partners of only one sex.  Within a decade the distinction between people marrying and just living together may be almost completely eroded as corporations begin to treat living together or having sex as being equivalent to a real marriage.<p>
The choice is not between straight only and both straight and gay marriage, it is between marriage and no marriage.  In other words, we are in a position where if we do not permit gay marriage we will end up ending marriage all together.  Homosexuals will be allowed to marry, de facto if not de jure.  The only choice left is to demand that the same principles of monogamy and devotion be applied across the board if we wish to preserve them at all.<p>

<a name=frontpage4></a><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+3>Proposition 22: Gay Marriage<br></font><font color=#23238E face="Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, sans-serif" size=+1><i>For Proposition 22<br></i></font>We are living in an increasingly politically correct age.  No one wants to offend any group.  But there is a point where the line has to be drawn.  Voting against proposition 22 is an example of political correctness going too far.  Not only do people want to keep from offending people, they are buckling under some pressure from certain groups.<p>
Equating homosexual marriage with heterosexual marriage is an attack on traditional family values.  Proposition 22 defends the increasingly deteriorating institution of marriage.  Children should not be brought up in an environment where a statistically abnormal behavior is legally deemed and, tacitly supporting, the behavior.<p>
One of the biggest arguments on the other side of the issue is that homosexuals couples, in many contexts, have more rights than heterosexual domestic couples.  The solution to this "problem" is not voting against proposition 22, thereby giving homosexual couples even more rights.  The solution is to make sure that domestic couples are treated the same as homosexual couples.<p>
Proposition 22 ensures that the values that three-quarters of the American population will survive.  It strengthens the religious and marital institutions by keeping with traditional values.  Till death do us part with our traditional values.<p>
