<a href=http://www.house.gov/campbell/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit Tom Campbell\'s House of Representatives Web Site','Tom Campbell'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>
Tom Campbell</a>, a popular Republican moderate, is hoping for a fifth successful run for national office.  But this time he may be jeopardizing his tenured position at the Stanford Law School.	<p>

	On October 26, Mr. Campbell announced that he would very likely enter the Senate race. Should he get the nomination, he would run against the incumbent Democrat <a href=http://www.senate.gov/~feinstein/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit Dian Fenstein\'s Senate Web Site','Diane Feinstein'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new> Feinstein</a>. Mr. Campbell is a moderate Republican. He is fiscally conservative, an opponent of the personal income tax, but socially libertarian on issues like gay rights and abortion.  Indeed, Milton Friedman was his thesis advisor at the <a href=http://www.uchicago.edu/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the University of Chicago Web Site','University of Chicago'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>University of Chicago</a>.<p>

	As a latecomer to the race facing a popular moderate with bipartisan support, political insiders feel that Mr. Campbell would do better to run in 2004 against the much more liberal Barbara Boxer. In fact, why should Mr. Campbell challenge Mrs. Feinstein, a formidable opponent, when he already has a safe seat? Colleagues say he is becoming frustrated in the House. His moderate views have alienated him from the GOP, which he often votes against on issues like gun control and abortion.  <p>

	Perhaps a more salient reason  involves his job security at Stanford.  Kathleen Sullivan, the newly appointed dean of the law school, has effectively given Campbell an ultimatum: if he does not resume his full time position at <a href=http://www.house.gov/campbell/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the Stanford University Web Site','Stanford University'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>Stanford</a> upon completing his current term in the House, he will lose tenure.<p>

            Says Mr. Campbell's political coordinator Amber Henninger, "Being a Representative is a two-year job. Being a Senator is a six-year job. Certainly, when faced with the idea of losing tenure, he probably thought about taking on a more long time position."<p>

           Mr. Campbell became a law professor in 1989, focusing on anti-trust, international, and constitutional law.  His pedigree includes a J.D. from Harvard as well as his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago.  Yet, except for a two-year hiatus from 1993 to 1995, he has been a member of the House since 1989, representing the South Bay area.  Mr. Campbell indicates repeatedly that he feels fortunate to have been able to teach for the past ten years while holding public office.<p>

            And if he should lose the Senate race?  Mr. Campbell says then he would definitely return to his professorship at Stanford.  Mr. Campbell will not discuss his talks with the university, but, though he is a full-time politician, he considers himself a teacher by profession.  While he is on leave from the law school, he gives seminars at Stanford's campus in Washington, one on international law and another on public policy issues with constitutional aspects.  <p>

	Is Tom Campbell irresponsible for taking on a political career after being granted tenure?  Should he have relinquished his Stanford position first?  Obviously, he wants to enjoy the best of both worlds.  If he does win election to the Senate, he would like to continue teaching.  The previous dean felt that his political experience was valuable enough for him to retain tenure.  The new dean apparently feels otherwise.<p>

Daniel Okimoto, <a href=http://www.billbradley.com/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the Bill Bradley Official Campaign Web Site','Bill Bradley'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>Bill Bradley's</a> top policy advisor, explained on October 27 why he supports Bill Bradley for president. Speaking in the Law School, he cited Bradley's integrity and quality of character as his most important attributes.<p>

	Okimoto is a Stanford professor of International Studies, but he is taking the year off to work full time on Bradley's campaign. During his presentation, he used a model to illustrate Bradley's qualities. "I'd like to use the letter C as a catch all category for who I think Bradley is," said Okimoto.<p>

	The qualities Okimoto listed were character, courage, curiosity, compassion, and conviction. "These five C's," Okimoto added, "add up to an A overall."<p>

	Okimoto praised Bradley's character. "I have very high standards. I'm usually critical of people. But (Bradley has) extraordinary honesty and integrity."<p>

	Okimoto stressed Bradley's "commitment to racial harmony and social justice." He said that Bradley was one of the first senator's to support the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Okimoto was born in a Japanese Internment Camp during World War II. It was with the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 that the American government acknowledged and apologized for that internment. He also included that Bradley has lent support to the Dakota Sioux Indians from South Dakota, and has supported the environment. Okimoto said that another one of Bradley's goals is to assist the "disenfranchised."<p>

	Okimoto insisted that Bradley "knows deeply about issues." He said, "(Bradley) is a man of insatiable curiosity." When later questioned, Okimoto said that Bradley was concerned specifically with race, the underprivileged, and foreign policy. He added, "Those are the issues that I would identify as most important to (Bradley)."<p>

	Okimoto called Bradley the most knowledgeable presidential candidate on issues of public policy. "He's practically the only candidate that I've ever met who could tell you the difference between a productivity approach to exchange rates and an expectations approach to exchange rates," Okimoto said. <p>

	He also said that campaign finance reform was important to Bradley. "(Bradley) is a person with courage and the independence to resist special interest groups," Okimoto said, adding Bradley also will not accept soft money. He said that <a href=http://www.georgewbush.com/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the George W. Bush Official Campaign Web Site','George W. Bush'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>George W. Bush</a> would likely have much more money that Bradley by the primaries. "It is rare that we find in politics a man of Bradley's character…As a politician, he is willing to take risks for causes he believes in," Okimoto said, later adding, "It may cost him the election."<p>

	Okimoto and Bradley first met at Princeton, where they were college roommates. Sports Illustrated recently named Bradley, who led Princeton to an NCAA championship, the 6th best college basketball player ever. Bradley also graduated as Rhodes Scholar. "What he did in the classroom had to do with what he did on the basketball court," said Okimoto, relating that to the work ethic Bradley now employs in politics.  <p>

	After illustrating each of the five C's, Okimoto said, "If I were to compare (Bradley) to a historical figure, I think it would be Abraham Lincoln. Both men had character, courage, and conviction. I think (Bradley) can redefine who we are, as Abraham Lincoln did, as a nation and as a diverse people."<p>

	Okimoto responded to several questions after his presentation. On the afternoon of September 27, Bradley had a debate with Al Gore at <a href=http://www.dartmouth.edu/ onMouseOver="drc('Visit the Dartmouth College Web Site','Dartmouth College'); return true;" onMouseOut="nd(); return true;" target=_new>Dartmouth College</a>. The audience watched three clips from the debate and asked questions about them.
	Students revealed various concerns. At Dartmouth, one reporter asked Bill Bradley what the one most compelling reason was to vote for him as president. He responded by talking about his stance on several issues, and a student at the presentation asked whether Bradley had a more concrete platform. 	<p>

	Another reporter at Dartmouth asked Bradley about healthcare. Bradley said, "There are forty five million people (in America) without healthcare. That is one million more than last year. It is a very serious problem." He continued to propose that we cover the costs of healthcare with either a government surplus or government savings incurred through changing the current healthcare administrative system with technology. One student asked whether that was realistic funding plan. Okimoto responded, "450 billion dollars a year is spent on transactions." We can use the Internet, he said, to make those transactions more efficient and thus save money. "It is impossible to guess," he added, "how much money we would save from 450 billion in transactions. In my opinion, it would surprise me if we couldn't save 100 billion." <p>

	A third reporter at Dartmouth asked Bradley about campaign finance. He responded in saying that, to reform the system, we needed a concerned public and devoted president. <p>

 	Other questions included an inquiry as to how likely it is that Bradley will win the election. Bradley was raised as a Republican, Okimoto noted, but switched to the Democratic Party in the 60's. The event was sponsored by the Stanford Democrats.
