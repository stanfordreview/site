        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">The 
              Review&#8217;s position is neither anti-gay nor anti-lesbian. Although 
              we will unquestionably be accused of all forms of bigotry and hate 
              mongering for this issue, The Review does not contend that theres 
              anything immoral about being a homosexual. Nor does The Review&#8217;s 
              stance in opposition of gay marriage have anything to do with hatred 
              or a mean spirit. This issue is about one simple fact: marriage 
              is between a man and a woman. The family is the most basic unit 
              of human civilization and to undermine it is to potentially undermine 
              the bedrock that we have built our beautiful cities and lives upon. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If we as a society are to tear 
              out a piece of the basic familial fabric that has defined us since 
              the earliest human times, we must ask ourselves what is to replace 
              it. Has the gay rights movement earned the maturity to warrant becoming 
              a pillar of our civilization? The flamboyant homosexuals of the 
              San Francisco gay pride parades appear more like a group of drunken 
              fraternity boys coated in body paint and makeup than a dignified 
              minority group arguing that it has the inherent moral authority 
              to warrant a fundamental change to the structure of our society. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Rewriting the rules of the world 
              is no task to be taken lightly. Man has always married woman. This 
              basic rule may need amending yet, but when the civil disobedience 
              of the homosexual community is marked not with the innate dignity 
              of Ghandi but rather that of Howard Stern, has that time come yet? 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Those who are in favor of gay 
              marriage have and will continue to present this debate as a battle 
              between the bigots and the hate mongers on one side and the progressive 
              and open-minded on the other. But this is nothing more than utter 
              deception and intimidation.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">This is a question of do we or 
              do we not want to amend the underpinnings that have defined civilized 
              society. I ask all of you, in considering your support for gay marriage, 
              to look inward and ask yourself how you believe society should operate. 
              If you feel that it is a time for change and time to grant a new 
              privilege to a group then by all means pursue it vigorously through 
              the appropriate legal channels. But if when you think family you 
              envision two children in the loving of embrace of a mother and father, 
              then don&#8217;t be afraid to stand up and say marriage is only 
              between a man and a woman. You are neither a hateful person nor 
              close-minded for feeling this way. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">I only hope in the end that those 
              who stand up and support gay marriage do it for the right reasons 
              and realize the full scale implications of their actions. <br>
