              University is as or more politically correct than any other institution 
              of higher learning in the country. We're known nation-wide for being 
              PC. Although there is some merit in being concerned with the sensitivities 
              of others, such behavior has gone too far. When a new class of freshmen 
              arrives at Stanford every fall, many of them attend an enlightening 
              diversity assembly at Memorial Auditorium with their dorms. This 
              activity brings to their attention the fact that they should not 
              discriminate and that certain people are sensitive to certain topics. 
              Such a message is certainly reasonable. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">However, an unusual and discomforting 
              fear in most people on this campus to express an actual opinion 
              that may offend someone seems to be all too commonplace. When controversial 
              subjects come up, people shy away from discussing the issue. Any 
              opinion that is an alternative to the mainstream campus liberal 
              view or one that is not completely politically correct is ostracized 
              immediately. This problem underlying Stanford social interactions 
              limits intellectual conversation and sharing of ideas, which are 
              what Stanford is supposed to be all about.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stanford's overly PC nature also 
              results in a general lack of a sense of humor on campus, for much 
              humor is based on controversial issues. People on campus are so 
              confined by the prison being politically correct places them in 
              that they feel they can't tell or laugh at a joke that would be 
              remotely offensive to anyone. These restrictions on social interactions, 
              if you abide by them, make for more mechanical and less enjoyable 
              conversations. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of truly racist 
              or sexist jokes. I do not support serious broad categorizations 
              and stereotyping of people. However, a person should be able to, 
              in jest, make a statement about something that involves race, gender, 
              creed, or sexual orientation without offending anyone. Unfortunately, 
              making such comments or jokes is a dangerous game at Stanford, a 
              fact that is learned quickly in one's freshman dorm. Jokes about 
              nerdy upperclassmen: OK. Jokes about the Stanford Administration: 
              OK. Jokes about women: Not OK. Not only do people watch what they 
              say too much, they take offense much too easily. By making their 
              peers more hesitant to express their true thoughts, those who are 
              overly politically correct are imposing their own restrictive beliefs 
              upon others' freedom of speech.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Individuals who have trapped themselves 
              in a fortress of being politically correct really ought to break 
              free and expose themselves to the full spectrum of beliefs that 
              are out there. If they neglect to do so, they will be rudely awakened 
              when they find out that the world at large is not as politically 
              correct as they would like it to be. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Being PC is just another way of 
              being closed-minded. Why can't we discuss immigration concerns, 
              affirmative action, financial aid, women's role in society, and 
              gay marriage without having the freedom to take a strong stance 
              on the issues that may offend someone? What if I say that I think 
              it's beneficial to society for women to stay at home to raise kids? 
              Is that too sexist for you? What if I like Stanford's current financial 
              aid system and I don't want to expand it? What if I support Schwarzenegger's 
              cutting of social programs to financially salvage the states budget? 
              Can we discuss that without you biting my head off? I'd love it 
              if we could. Can I criticize our current affirmative action policy 
              structure and say it should be based on income and not race? Can 
              we discuss these topics without becoming emotional? With some students, 
              such discussions are possible. However, many of the Stanford population 
              are drowning in the PC cesspool that makes such conversations virtually 
              impossible. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">America's nature as a multi-cultural 
              society inherently forces the average person to be sensitive to 
              others issues. However, in the setting of many universities (and 
              especially Stanford), being politically correct has gone too far. 
              With the current situation as it stands, PC students aren't leaving 
              here with a complete understanding of the issues that are facing 
              our nation and world today. Furthermore, those afraid to speak their 
              minds aren't learning to confidently state their real opinions for 
              fear of being shunned. People ought to be able to voice their opinions, 
              perhaps offending a few people, and then listen to alternative views 
              with an open mind. That to me is the type of interaction that should 
              be occurring at Stanford. There are many smart people here: let's 
              hear from them all. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">After all, this is supposed to 
              be a university dedicated to the free-exchange of thought above 
              anything else. How does an atmosphere where certain ideas are deemed 
              unspeakable promote this goal? Can we honestly fancy ourselves as 
              intellectuals when the mere mention of certain phrases makes us 
              cringe? 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">We must remove the oppressive 
              PC blanket at Stanford which smothers intellectual discussion and 
              restricts many opportunities for learning. People's inability to 
              express themselves honestly and openly limits the scope of ideas 
              and opinions students would otherwise be exposed to. Everyone ought 
              to loosen up a bit. Laugh more. If you have a funny thought in your 
              head about a controversial topic, share it. We should all want to 
              learn more about each others opinions, but we can only do so if 
              all opinions are able to be openly discussed without being repressed. 
              Never let the possibility that you may offend someone keep you from 
              making an assertion of your ideas and values, and just try to not 
              be so offended by other people's opinions. Break through the oppression 
              that Stanford's political correctness has placed upon us. I have, 
              and trust me -- the other side is much better.
