          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">The 
              Defense of Marriage Act states that the word 'marriage' means only 
              a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife. 
              Marriage as it exists today is an integral part of our society. 
              It is the seal that binds a couple and allows for the formation 
              of that all-important unit of society: the family. Accordingly, 
              we as a society place great importance on the institution of marriage 
              and see its value clearly. However, gay rights activists are now 
              pushing for the legalization of gay marriage, something that would 
              do much to harm the institution of marriage as a whole as well as 
              the many heterosexual marriages formed by it.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Furthermore, allowing for gay 
              marriage opens the door to further and more extreme degradations 
              of marriage. Legalizing gay marriage provides a precedent for polygamists 
              and polyamorists to demand the right for their marriages to be legalized 
              as well. Once such groups gain the right to marriage, the term will 
              come to represent a bond or bonds, weak or strong, between any number 
              of individuals of any sex or sexual orientation. What then will 
              be special about a heterosexual couple getting married? Their marriage 
              will mean just as much as that between three men and two women. 
              Some argue that allowing gay marriage would not lead to the legitimization 
              of group marriages, saying that each scenario would be considered 
              individually. However, altering the basic structure of the institution 
              of marriage does provide a precedent for further modifications.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">After all, the argument used by 
              homosexuals is that they ought to have the right to marry whomever 
              they want, male or female. If we legalize gay marriage, we will 
              in effect be making the statement that everyone ought to have the 
              right to marry whomever they want, regardless of their sexual preferences. 
              We could obviously not then deny polygamists and polyamorists from 
              having the right to enter into group marriages, for they are simply 
              people of different sexual preferences. If we allow the institution 
              of marriage to be so broadened and corrupted, not only will it have 
              no longer have any meaning for heterosexual couples, it will lose 
              its meaning for gay couples and everyone else that is married, an 
              end result that benefits no one.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">In addition, polyamory and polygamy 
              will remove monogamy from the meaning of marriage. If people in 
              a group marriage can be married and yet sleep with multiple people, 
              it will make infidelity in traditional, heterosexual marriage seem 
              more acceptable. With the already alarming level of divorces in 
              this country, marriage means less today than it ever has, and we 
              cannot afford to permit any further modifications of the institution 
              of marriage that would further weaken the strength of its meaning. 
              If we do, we could very well witness the effective end of meaningful 
              marriage as we once knew it.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">According to many nationwide polls, 
              those opposing gay marriage outnumber those supporting it by a factor 
              of two. Hence, there is no popular mandate for the legalization 
              of gay marriage. The United States laws (as well as its constituent 
              states laws) ought to reflect the opinions of the majority, especially 
              in cases such as these where the outcomes affects such a great number 
              of people. The legalization of gay marriage, in either an individual 
              state or in the United States as a whole, would force those who 
              are opposed to it to support it by association with their state 
              or country. We ought to respect the majority of the United States 
              citizens, who wish to preserve the current meaning of the term marriage 
              because it defines and gives meaning to their relationships with 
              their husbands and wives. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">By asking for the right to gay 
              marriage, homosexuals are forcing heterosexuals to equate their 
              own relationships to those between two gay people, something that 
              for those opposed to gay marriage would change how they view their 
              own marriages. Many heterosexual couples feel that gay marriage 
              degrades the quality and strength of meaning behind their own marriage, 
              for it broadens the term to include a union looked down upon by 
              many. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Gay marriage is obviously a widely-discussed, 
              heated, and controversial topic of debate. However, the duty of 
              a country is to protect the rights of its citizens. In the case 
              of gay marriage, where the rights of two different groups are mutually 
              exclusive, we must defer to the larger, majority group. If we continue 
              to grant rights to minority groups that impinge upon those of majority 
              groups, our country will be no longer be governed by anything even 
              resembling democracy.<br>
