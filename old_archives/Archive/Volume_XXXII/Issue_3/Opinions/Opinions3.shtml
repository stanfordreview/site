          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">More 
              than three thousand gay and lesbian marriages have taken place in 
              San Francisco this month. Most lives in the Bay Area havent changed. 
              Families are going about their days as usual, college students are 
              as moral as they were before, and society as a whole is no more 
              broken than it was last February. No god has let loose his wrath 
              on us.<br>
              Those against same-sex marriage argue that it will wreak horrible 
              moral and practical damages on society. Empirically and logically, 
              they are wrong.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Marriage, as it is regulated across 
              the country, isn't as pristine as those who say gay marriage will 
              hurt the sanctity of marriage envision it. Heterosexual couples, 
              if they even choose to become husbands and wives, mistreat each 
              other, get divorced, and don't give sufficient attention to their 
              children.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Heterosexual couples have long 
              since destroyed pristine marriage. While the millions of dysfunctional 
              and failed marriages are sad, there are still plenty of healthy, 
              happy, and intact marriages.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If neglect, abuse, and divorce 
              in some marriages haven't hurt other marriages, then allowing committed 
              life partners of the same sex the legal protection of marriage certainly 
              won't harm anyone's heterosexual marriage.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Since same-sex marriage won't 
              harm society any more than heterosexual marriage has, that leaves 
              the moral argument against same-sex marriage.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It is admirable to live a moral 
              life as one's religion or spirituality defines morality. However, 
              it is widely recognized that religion ought not to dictate laws 
              because laws based on the religions of some unfairly impose on the 
              consciences of others. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It would be un-American and unconstitutional 
              to have laws that proscribed belief in any gods other than the Christian 
              God, even though many Christians think that those who don't believe 
              in their God will burn in hell. When creating law, it doesnt matter 
              what any one religion believes the consequence of a given action 
              will be.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Laws that reflect religious values 
              are allowed only so long as they have universal application regardless 
              of religion. Murder is prohibited because it takes away an individual's 
              dearest property (his life), not because God forbade it in the Ten 
              Commandments.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Same-sex relationships may be 
              abhorred by a number of religions, but religion does not and ought 
              not to decide the rights granted or taken away by the government.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If one looks at civil marriage 
              from a practical standpoint, it is a contract between two people 
              to love and be faithful to each other for life. The government, 
              in recognition of the special nature of this contract, codifies 
              rights that are in accord with the intertwined lives that the contract 
              makes.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">No one is hurt when homosexual 
              couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples to visit each 
              other in the hospital, have their life commitment recognized, file 
              taxes jointly, get death benefits, or any of the other myriad privileges 
              of the married.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Legalizing same-sex marriage does 
              make a difference. The lives of 6,000 homosexual Americans have 
              already been enriched by marriage. The futures of countless more 
              have been brightened by the prospect that they can have the same 
              legal recognition as their heterosexual friends and families when 
              they decide to devote the rest of their lives to someone. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Finally, while the majority of 
              Americans arent homosexual, the legalization of same-sex marriage 
              is good for all Americans because it affirms dedication to equal 
              protection under the law of this country.<br>
