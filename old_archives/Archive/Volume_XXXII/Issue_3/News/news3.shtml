          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">A 
              small group of students, mostly from the Jewish community at Stanford, 
              gathered in Rains Buttery on Wed., Feb. 18 to hear the message of 
              a concerned Israeli Bedouin. Ishmael Khaldi, diplomat in training, 
              has spoken at over sixty universities across the U.S. and Canada 
              since November 2002, determined to fulfill an obligation he feels 
              to &quot;share his story&quot; of a mutually beneficial relationship 
              between Bedouins and Israelis. He feels that historical Israeli 
              help and current policy toward the Bedouins, a Muslim people, removes 
              credibility from accusation of Israeli racism towards Muslims.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Roughly 150,000 Bedouins (2.6% 
              of the total population) inhabit Israel. Bedouins are traditionally 
              nomadic shepherds, living in sturdy tents in large, closely-knit 
              family units. They hold strongly to conservative values and customs 
              and prefer to remain somewhat culturally isolated for their own 
              stability. Khaldi characterizes them as respectful of others' rights 
              and differing values, though they resist modernization. &quot;They 
              are more secular&quot; than other Arab factions in the Middle East, 
              which makes them somewhat of an outcast group in the eyes of the 
              Islamic world. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">When the Zionists came in 1917 
              to inhabit the land that would become Israel, the Bedouin worked 
              &quot;side by side&quot; with them to build the kibbutzim and to 
              fight Britain and Arab nations. Because of friendships with early 
              Jewish immigrants, Khaldis grandmother spoke Yiddish. A &quot;blood 
              covenant&quot; developed between Israelis and Bedouins, and Khaldi 
              feels that now, &quot;Israel's fate is our fate.&quot; He repeated 
              many times that he truly sees himself as an Israeli and takes pride 
              in that identity, though his ties to his own culture are strong.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Living now in the boundaries of 
              one of the most modernized Middle Eastern countries, Bedouins have 
              had the benefit of help from Israel to &quot;settle down,&quot; 
              establish sanitation facilities, medical care, and schools. The 
              change is occurring gradually: Khaldi's family lived in a tent with 
              11 children, and he was a shepherd until age 8. He said, &quot;it 
              was hard,&quot; but from the work he gained strong familial bonds 
              and a great work ethic. His village got electricity only two years 
              ago, and the slow pace of technology's entrance into their society 
              is welcome to Khaldi. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Not being accustomed to amenities, 
              he says that the Bedouin are better without the luxuries he sees 
              as detrimental to American society, which retains &quot;nothing 
              about family values.&quot; When his brother donned a stylish belt, 
              he was outraged, feeling that &quot;next would come the earring, 
              the tattoo, the hippie haircut.&quot; He takes pride in the Bedouins' 
              simplicity and sees American society as indulgent. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Khaldi retains his ties to home 
              and his conservative views while immersing himself in global society 
              and its problems. After graduating high school, he went to New York, 
              a rare opportunity for a Bedouin, and became determined to use the 
              lessons he learned while traveling for the good of his country and 
              people. He studied political science at Tel Aviv University and 
              served in the Israeli Defense Force and as a political analyst for 
              the Israel Defense Ministry. Bedouins are not required to serve 
              in the Israeli military, which would force them to leave behind 
              their families and livestock. Yet many men, including Khaldi, serve 
              out of respect for Israel and its troubles with the knowledge that 
              they will be protected should the need arise. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Khaldi grew up in northern Israel, 
              between Haifa and Nazareth. Bedouins here have fairly stable settlements 
              and increasing access to resources. The majority of Israeli Bedouins 
              (120,000), live in the southern Negev desert in settlements over 
              which debate of legality has raged. Khaldi pointed out that many 
              of the conflicts over Bedouin settlements are exacerbated by the 
              fact that they do not traditionally value owning land. Though he 
              supports the Israeli people and nation, he feels that the bureaucracy 
              is flawed and that this is one of many situations that could have 
              been handled better.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The government is currently implementing 
              a plan to resettle southern Bedouins and improve their living conditions. 
              An attendee of Khaldis talk questioned him about Israeli treatment 
              of Bedouins that contrasted with the helpful &quot;blood covenant&quot; 
              he portrayed. The student cited the bombing of a mosque, property 
              qualifications for government services, and the spraying of Bedouin 
              crops in an unlicensed area. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Khaldi admitted that the Israeli 
              government is not perfect, stressing that they are dealing with 
              many problems right now. He praised the efforts of Israel to actively 
              bring in terrorized groups, such as the Ethiopian Jews and Russian 
              Jews from the USSR, when they were no longer safe in their homelands. 
              In Israel, these minorities are living in even worse conditions 
              than Bedouins, but Khaldi considers them all to be better off than 
              the alternative. Khaldi criticizes those who expect Israel to solve 
              all the complexities of cultural clashes and value differences among 
              its citizens, especially since it is much freer country than those 
              that surround it.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Khaldi emphasizes that difficulties 
              in aiding Israel's citizens, minorities and Jews alike, stem from 
              the critical defense issues that Israel currently faces. With random 
              violence being perpetuated in public places, the Israeli government 
              has to concentrate on saving the lives of its citizens. Khaldi says 
              that despite any problems the Bedouins face as a people, &quot;destiny 
              or fate&quot; has linked them to the Jews by the very &quot;human&quot; 
              desire to stop senseless killing.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Khaldi proposes these solutions 
              that he sees coming soon: a two-state society with a responsible 
              leader, since &quot;Arafat is not doing anything.&quot; Israel and 
              Sharon want conciliation but do not want all the responsibility; 
              Palestinian leadership should also be blocking terrorism. As a Muslim, 
              Khaldi has been hated by others who feel he is a hypocrite. To those 
              who say that security fence money could be better spent on humanitarian 
              causes, such as the improvement of Bedouin living conditions, he 
              says that the death must end first. With an air of disgust for those 
              who target civilians, he said, &quot;If my brother who grew up next 
              to me became a suicide bomber, I would kill him, even tomorrow morning.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Ishmael's reception at Stanford 
              was mild; he was banned from speaking at Langara College in Vancouver, 
              though a conference entitled &quot;Why Israel is an Apartheid State&quot; 
              was held days earlier. At Rutgers University in New Jersey students 
              shouted questions and interrupted Khaldi, forcing him to step away 
              from the podium. Over dinner after the talk, he expressed his surprise 
              at the lack of factual knowledge about Israeli history among students 
              in the U.S., particularly Jewish young adults who challenge Israeli 
              policy.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Ishmael, whose name means &quot;God 
              will hear&quot; in Hebrew, was brought by the Stanford Israel Alliance. 
              Advoacy V.P. Dan Kaganovich extends the hope that Khaldi's unique 
              message of tolerance be heard by as many people as possible.<br>
