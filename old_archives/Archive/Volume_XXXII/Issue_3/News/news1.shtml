          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext"><img src="../images/newsom.jpg" width="144" height="184" hspace="10" border="2" align="right">San 
              Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced this month that he was instructing 
              the county clerk to &quot;issue marriage licenses in order to provide 
              marriage licenses on a non-discriminatory basis, without regard 
              to gender or sexual orientation.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The mayor found the old policy 
              of granting marriage licenses just to heterosexual couples a violation 
              of the California Constitution, which he swore to uphold when he 
              took office. Furthermore, Newsom declares that, &quot;There is no 
              rationale for discrimination against any individuals in California.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 
              issued a statement on Feb. 19 stating that the marriage licenses 
              submitted by San Francisco &quot;fail to meet legal standards.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">He notes that he is sworn to uphold 
              California laws, including Proposition 22, passed in 2000, which 
              limits legally recognizable marriage to unions between a man and 
              a woman. As such, he instructed the attorney general to &quot;vigorously 
              defend the constitutionality of Proposition 22.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">While the reaction on campus has 
              been rather muted, with no major rallies or protests, the issue 
              of same-sex marriage has not gone unnoticed.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Freshman Sam Altman, Executive 
              Director of ForGayMarriage.org, a group that he started at Stanford 
              but which now has national presence, praises Newsom's decision as 
              &quot;another step towards equality.&quot; However, he notes, &quot;I 
              wish [Newsom] could uphold the law and the Constitution,&quot; but 
              as &quot;the Constitution is above the law,&quot; and allowing same-sex 
              marriage is &quot;the right thing,&quot; he is on the whole in favor 
              of the measure.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">There have been strong national 
              reactions, both positive and negative to the granting of marriage 
              licenses to homosexual couples.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The Washington, D.C-based gay, 
              lesbian, bisexual, and transgender advocacy group Human Rights Campaign 
              is strongly in favor of Mayor Newsom's decision.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">HRC President Cheryl Jacques stresses 
              the effect of the decision on individuals: &quot;Del Martin and 
              Phyllis Lyon [a couple allowed to wed because of Newsom's decision], 
              have spent the last 51 years of their lives together. There is absolutely 
              no good reason for a couple so loving and so committed to each other 
              to be denied the right to marry and the thousands of protections 
              that come with it. [This] historic step will result only in making 
              families a like Del and Phyllis a stronger.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Tony Perkins, President of the 
              socially conservative Family Research Council, also based in Washington, 
              condemns Newsom's decision, citing the snowball effect. Sandoval 
              County, New Mexico, has started granting marriage licenses to homosexual 
              couples as well, and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley announced his support 
              for same-sex marriage in Chicago when San Francisco stopped discriminating 
              on the basis of sexual orientation when granting marriage licenses.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">&quot;We cannot permit a few states 
              and cities to force same-sex 'marriage' on the rest of America...,&quot; 
              Perkins declared.<br>
