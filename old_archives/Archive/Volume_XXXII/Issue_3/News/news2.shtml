          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">For 
              years, many high school students have visited graduate housing at 
              Stanford, soliciting newspaper subscriptions for the San Francisco 
              Chronicle or San Jose Mercury News, which they say allows them to 
              receive scholarships that will help pay for college.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The students are typically low-income 
              minorities, many of them claiming to be recent immigrants from European 
              or African countries. They all have one thing in common: they say 
              that they are selling newspaper subscriptions because they are financially 
              strapped and need money for college.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">California Newspaper Sales &amp; 
              Marketing, the largest contractor hired by both the Chronicle and 
              Mercury News to sell subscriptions, and a major contractor responsible 
              for the Stanford area, says that they do not look for any particular 
              profile when hiring these students, as long as the students are 
              doing well in school. Most of the students, they say, have a stable 
              family life and a potential future -- as long as they can obtain 
              the money to pay for school.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The students soliciting at Stanford 
              paint a different picture, however. According to several graduate 
              residents, the students often cite a difficult family life as one 
              of the chief reasons they will have so much difficulty paying for 
              college. One high school student claimed he was an orphan. Another 
              said he was a member of a single-parent household.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The sales strategy is clear: the 
              contractors hire these young adults because they will engender sympathy 
              among many, encouraging them to purchase a subscription in order 
              to help the student go to college. Every person we talked to who 
              purchased a subscription said their chief reason for doing so was 
              the sympathy they felt for the student.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The students carry printed material 
              that says that if they sell enough subscriptions, they will receive 
              a $500 scholarship for college. According to these documents, they 
              receive 15 points for each short-term subscription (more for longer 
              ones), and if they obtain 515 points, they will receive a scholarship.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">That claim is anything but the 
              truth. In reality, there is no guarantee the money the students 
              earn will go towards a college education. The students do not receive 
              scholarships; they receive money that can be spent on anything -- 
              not just a college education. The students are paid by check on 
              a regular basis, just like any other part-time job. If they are 
              older than 18, they receive the check directly. Otherwise, the check 
              goes to their parents.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The contractors take no responsibility 
              for where the money goes and make no effort to ensure that it truly 
              goes towards a college education. Eric Abrahams, who works for California 
              Newspaper Sales &amp; Marketing, explicitly denied that they tell 
              the students to say that they need money for school. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">He said that it is possible the 
              students discovered that such a sales technique is what works, and 
              the idea simply spread, noting, &quot;We do not control what they 
              say out there. Some of these students use anything to make the customers 
              feel sorry for them.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mr. Abrahams estimates that each 
              student makes $200-300 each week. Graduate students who have been 
              approached by the solicitors, however, did not believe that assertion. 
              Many said that when they asked the students how much money they 
              received for each subscription, the margins were extremely low, 
              and they could not see how a week's worth of work would result in 
              that much money. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">In addition, the success rate 
              of selling the subscriptions is about 10% according to Mr. Abrahams, 
              so the students must approach many individuals in order to earn 
              a significant amount of money.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">One student who asked to remain 
              anonymous said that he does not buy subscriptions &quot;because 
              these kids are being exploited, and purchasing subscriptions only 
              encourages them to keep coming back.&quot;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">This belief is common among graduate 
              residents at Stanford, most of who think that the contractors are 
              exploiting the high school students' financial situation for their 
              own financial gain.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Medical student Becky Kim cited 
              the students' aggressiveness as a reason why she will not listen 
              to their sales pitches. Most Stanford students described the high 
              schoolers as being very persistent, saying that when they ask a 
              student to leave, the student often makes desperate verbal pleas 
              for the potential buyer to purchase a subscription. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Many times, as a last resort, 
              the students ask for donations if there is no interest in a subscription. 
              In one case, after a grad student told a solicitor to leave, the 
              solicitor sat on the steps outside of the students residence.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Graduate students are universally 
              annoyed that the students periodically come to their doors multiple 
              times during the year, an activity that has gone on for several 
              years. Just the mention of these solicitors brought immediate negative 
              reactions from nearly every graduate resident interviewed.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Students generally start working 
              around 5 and end around 7 or 7:30 PM on weeknights, and 9 PM on 
              weekends. They can be transported about 25 miles from their home 
              during the week, and 50-100 miles on weekends, provided they have 
              the parents' permission.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">California Newspaper Sales &amp; 
              Marketing is just one of many companies doing the same thing, and 
              even the contractors contract out to other individuals who manage 
              the sales crews. All of the various contractors refused to give 
              out the names or numbers of any of the crew managers who are directly 
              responsible for the students, citing privacy concerns and contractual 
              obligations.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">California Newspaper Sales &amp; 
              Marketing has ten crew members, each of which generally has 8-10 
              sales representatives. They employ approximately 60-70 sales representatives. 
              The managers are responsible for transporting the students to and 
              from the locations in which they will sell subscriptions. The company 
              sells between 1200-1500 subscriptions per week.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Signing up for the program means 
              that a Stanford student will receive several weeks of one of the 
              papers on a trial basis. If they do not wish to have the service, 
              they can cancel it and get their money back, but the students will 
              only receive commission if people have had the newspaper for 30 
              days.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">As an experiment, I subscribed 
              to both the San Jose Mercury News and the San Francisco Chronicle. 
              I received the Chronicle within a week and a half but have yet to 
              receive a copy of the Mercury News, nearly three weeks later, though 
              the check has not yet been cashed.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Interestingly, small type on the 
              bottom of a Mercury News receipt says, &quot;Payments made to the 
              Mercury News are solely for newspaper subscriptions and are not 
              to be solicited as college tuition or donations.&quot;
