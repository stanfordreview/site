          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Islamic 
              terrorists planted 12 backpack bombs and the Spanish people surrendered. 
              They immediately switched from supporting a Spanish government that 
              had backed the war on terror to electing a socialist enemy of the 
              war on terror. We now have a scientific measure of Spanish instincts. 
              They can be described in one word: female.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Faced with the choice of whether 
              to fight against a violent invasion or surrender to it, men and 
              women face very different, sometimes opposite, biological imperatives. 
              Throughout mankind&#8217;s evolutionary history, if a man fought 
              against an invader he risked death in proportion to the strength 
              of his foe, while if he surrendered, he faced almost certain death, 
              at least in the biological sense. At best he would be enslaved and 
              denied further access to females. Thus the reproductively more successful 
              strategy for a man would almost always be to fight invaders, and 
              this is how we should expect the male instincts to be programmed, 
              according to the precepts of evolutionary psychology.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">For a woman, fighting against 
              an invader also risks death, but surrender offers much better reproductive 
              prospects for women than for men. A woman&#8217;s reproductive capacity 
              is part of the booty, often the primary booty, that invaders have 
              always been after. Thus a fertile woman could almost be guaranteed 
              that, with surrender, her reproductive capacity would not be wasted. 
              This difference in biological incentives will have left women with 
              stronger instincts to surrender.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The disparity between male and 
              female instincts is watered down by the biological incentives that 
              men and women have in common. Both have incentive to save their 
              existing children from being killed or enslaved, especially their 
              boys. (Enslaved girls will still reproduce.) But the disparity still 
              remains. Women with children should have a marginally stronger instinct 
              to surrender than men do, while young childless women should have 
              a much stronger instinct to surrender.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The poll watching group Public 
              Opinion Watch has commented on what it calls the &#8220;interesting 
              paradox&#8221; that &#8220;women are substantially more worried 
              about being victims of a terrorist attack than men, yet appear to 
              be substantially less supportive of the Bush administration&#8217;s 
              Iraq policy, ostensibly designed to protect American citizens from 
              terror.&#8221; This &#8220;paradox&#8221; can be taken as a measure 
              of the greater female instinct to assume a submissive posture.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Demographers have also found that 
              America&#8217;s appeasement party&#8212;still officially called 
              the Democrat party&#8212;is the party of single women, while the 
              Republicans are the party of married women. In this case, however, 
              the statistical gap probably overstates the female lay down effect, 
              due to entanglement with other factors. Many single mothers effectively 
              marry the government by going on welfare, and since the Democrats 
              created welfare, they see the Democrats as the husband figure in 
              this relationship. Some of these women might well want to fight 
              to protect their children, but still go with the party of appeasement 
              because they are married in.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Anthropological evidence is available 
              from the discovery of the primitive Yanomamo people, hidden deep 
              in the rain forests of South America. When Napoleon Chagnon studied 
              the Yanomamo (&#8220;the fierce people&#8221;), he discovered a 
              violent society where a quarter of the men were killed by other 
              Yanomamo, mostly in woman-stealing raids between different Yanomamo 
              tribes. Having to survive as a prize of war was very common for 
              Yanomamo women. Add territorial conquest to the equation, where 
              fighting invaders becomes even more of an imperative for men, and 
              the difference between male and female instinct becomes even stronger.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">There is no suggestion here that 
              male instinct is inherently better than female instinct. It is, 
              however, manifestly better as the rational strategy for a nation. 
              To appease aggressors is always and everywhere to encourage them. 
              Osama Bin Laden has listed the return of Andalusia to Muslim domination 
              as one of his primary objectives. To Al Qaeda, no Muslim state must 
              ever become non-Muslim, and Spain is the most prominent example 
              of Muslim reversal. Terrorist ambition is fixed squarely on Spain 
              as its first western conquest.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">For a modern nation to surrender 
              to a band of primitives over twelve backpack bombs is insane. You 
              can always submit later, senoritas, after Spain has been defeated. 
              There is no immediate need to get down on your backs. That is just 
              your sex talking: the terrified Yanomamo girls inside, hoping to 
              survive. The personal must not be political, not the female personal, 
              not when the nation is under attack.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Unfortunately, everything is personal 
              for women, including politics, at least at the level of biological 
              disposition. Women, throughout our evolutionary history, have lived 
              their lives under the power of men. While men have looked outward, 
              engaging the world outside the home in order to provide for the 
              home, women have looked inward, managing the household and establishing 
              their status in it through their emotional relationship with the 
              resident political authority, the man. Men and women both have the 
              same open ended faculties to discover and pursue value, but the 
              difference in our instinctive natures is large.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Faced with an invader, the combination 
              of woman&#8217;s instinct to submit, and the tendency for her political 
              thinking to revolve around the personal, can be a disastrous pairing 
              for a nation that allows women to vote. The problem is even worse 
              in Europe because European society has become thoroughly feminized. 
              The European man no longer thinks like a man.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">How is it possible for male instinct 
              to be occluded? Very simple: instinct is shaped by calculations 
              of reproductive benefit, crunched numerically by natural selection. 
              Our open ended faculties of intelligence grasp and reinforce these 
              calculations. By changing the conditions in which boys are raised, 
              the risk-reward calculations they face can be shaped so as to set 
              their rational faculties against their instincts, causing instinct 
              to be suppressed.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Consider the impact of European 
              civilian disarmament. Every Spanish man, from the time he was a 
              boy, has been deprived of the means to defend himself and others. 
              Faced with any serious violent threat, from as little as a knife 
              or a piece of pipe, he has always been at a total disadvantage. 
              His open ended faculties of intelligence have always understood 
              clearly that his only rational course is to flee.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The normal male biological calculation&#8212; 
              that it makes sense to fight in defense of self and others&#8212;is 
              conditioned (in our evolutionary number crunching) on a man having 
              done what he can to be prepared to fight. Our ancestors did not 
              disarm themselves! Europe, by not allowing its boys ever to be prepared 
              to fight, sets their rational faculties to overcome their biological 
              nature. Instead of coming to grips with the moral use of force, 
              European male character formation all occurs in conditions that 
              push males to the female calculation: that it is better to submit.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The result is a vagina monologue. 
              European males and females both see the world in the instinctive 
              female way, as the Spanish displayed last month. By choosing not 
              to fight for their survival, the Spanish are, at the biological 
              level, seeking to survive by making babies for the invader. Here 
              in America, our women (or at least our Republican women), grow up 
              thinking of themselves and their men as armed. Thus their rational 
              faculties grasp that it makes sense to fight. Faced with an attacker, 
              it is the female instinct that gets overruled.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Such good girls, even helping 
              out behind the lines while our boys methodically stuff the Jihadis 
              into the meat grinder. There is a long way to go, but women, don&#8217;t 
              worry. We will never let the vermin take you. You can go to them 
              if you want, the flakes amongst you. We allow you your weakness. 
              What we love is your strength.
