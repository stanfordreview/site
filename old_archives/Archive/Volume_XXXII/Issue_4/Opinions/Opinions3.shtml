              am going to let you in on a little secret - there is NO dating at 
              Stanford. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">&#8220;What?&#8221; you say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve 
              never heard this a thousand times before!&#8221; I know, you&#8217;ve 
              never talked about it with any of your friends, or read any of the 
              hundreds of Stanford Daily articles, or seen the repeated warnings 
              in the Approaching Stanford pamphlets. The fact of the matter is 
              we are bombarded with a tornado-like-fury of articles and every-day 
              conversation about the dismal level of Stanford dating, so it&#8217;s 
              beginning to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. On top of this, 
              there are so many theories about the cause of the situation and 
              how it should be fixed, no wonder so many of our fellow students 
              find the whole situation so overwhelming lame that they decide to 
              stick with the status quo - study most of the time and perform the 
              role of the typical Stanford dork.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Now don&#8217;t get me wrong. 
              I admit to being a pretty huge dork myself &#8211; who are we kidding 
              anyway; we all go to Stanford right? My noble goal is to clear-up 
              some of this nonsense by presenting the Top Four reasons there&#8217;s 
              no dating at Stanford (Why not top five? Well&#8230;stop asking 
              stupid questions). Not only will this provide you with essential 
              information on the topic, but now you don&#8217;t have to read all 
              of those other annoying articles about dating. So, without further 
              adieu, here are the Top Four reasons Stanford students don&#8217;t 
              date:
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext"><strong>Stanford Guys are Pansies</strong>
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Yes, you heard me right, when 
              it comes to placing blame on the deficiency of Stanford dating it 
              usually falls squarely on the insecure, socially inept, and bumbling 
              idiots fondly known as &#8220;Stanford Guys.&#8221; Naturally, these 
              men are overachievers in most every way, except when it comes to 
              simple social conventions. For instance, the typical Stanford male 
              can easily write a senior thesis about: the distribution, hybridization, 
              and morphology of Mytilus trossulus, Mytilus galloprovincialis and 
              their hybrids in marine communities adjacent to aquaculture operations 
              in Puget Sound. However, when it comes to flirting with someone, 
              the only words that can be heard through the sporadic drooling and 
              nervous twitching are &#8220;you want to come over to my sheets&#8211;I 
              mean dorm&#8230;for some hot, passionate&#8211; um&#8230;tea? Ahhh, 
              what I mean is&#8230;see you tomorrow in class?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">This theory has been promoted 
              by many people, especially the writers of what seems to be a constant 
              stream of articles begging us men to grow some cajones and start 
              asking girls out. The traditional casual date has become extinct 
              on this campus, but was it necessarily triggered by pansy males? 
              This is where the next excuse comes into play.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext"><strong>Stanford Girls are Ugly</strong>
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">So lots of you guys believe that 
              the &#8220;real&#8221; reason there is no dating on this campus 
              is because the average Stanford girl looks like a mutilated swamp-beast. 
              Men aren&#8217;t insecure with asking girls out; just asking ugly 
              girls out. Then the argument is usually backed up by the fact that 
              some magazine ranked the hottest colleges, with Stanford guys in 
              fourth and the girls making a dismal appearance at 400th. And just 
              to make the argument even more damning, they maintain that not only 
              are most Stanford girls ugly, they have the subtle charm of serial 
              killers and the tender compassion and understanding of starving 
              hyenas on speed.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Clearly many of these comments 
              are made out of the extreme frustrations of the Stanford male. Are 
              Stanford girls really that ugly? Contrary to popular belief, there 
              are many hot girls on this campus (who are especially noticeable 
              during spring time!). Of course, we can&#8217;t lie and say that 
              all the girls are drop dead gorgeous, but let&#8217;s be honest, 
              neither are the guys. Most of the ivy league-type schools are filled 
              with high-achievers of both sexes who, for some reason or another, 
              tend to be sub-par in the hotness department. One particularly important 
              point is that the alleged Playboy magazine article ranking Stanford 
              guys and girls never existed. In fact, this urban myth not only 
              pertains to Stanford; similar variants have been floating around 
              hundreds of colleges throughout the country. Playboy has finally 
              decided to capitalize on the idea by publishing the first ever top-ten 
              colleges with the hottest girls (see their website for rankings).
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext"><strong>Highly Motivated and Intellectually 
              Curious Stanford Students = No Fun</strong>
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Another one of the foremost theories 
              on the depressing level of dating at Stanford is that we are so 
              motivated we would rather skip dinner, do two problem sets, finish 
              some essays, and check our email every five minutes than go on exciting 
              dates. This may seem weird, but just take a visit to Meyer Library 
              on a Friday or Saturday night and you will realize there are way 
              too many people not &#8220;not doing work.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stanford students are just too 
              motivated. We all tend to suffer from a severe form of delayed gratification. 
              We would much rather go through a living hell now to achieve a moderate 
              increase in happiness in the future. While normal human beings prefer 
              to live in the present, only suffering pain if it leads to a large 
              reward, victims of delayed gratification often find themselves going 
              through decades of schooling, nonstop work, and are finally diagnosed 
              as workaholics (yippee). The solution is to drop a couple clubs, 
              take fewer classes and just enjoy life.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext"><strong>Contemporary Ideas About 
              Gender Roles and Relationships Leave Many Clueless</strong>
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">One of the latest arguments about 
              dating at Stanford is that our politically correct society makes 
              it hard to know what to do or say without being labeled a racist, 
              sexist, bigot, or one of the other more colorful terms used to describe 
              people voicing their opinions. Perhaps PC culture has &#8220;increased 
              tolerance for diversity,&#8221; but it has also left many people 
              wondering what to do in social situations such as dating. Should 
              the guy pick up the tab at dinner and risk being called a chauvinist? 
              Should girls ask guys on dates, or is that still considered being 
              too aggressive? Should I even take the risks involved with all this 
              nonsense, or just sit in the corner of my room? These are all good 
              questions with no clear answer, and that is why lots of people are 
              focusing on this contemporary problem.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext"><strong>In the End</strong>
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Almost every article about the 
              lack of Stanford dating focuses on one reason there&#8217;s no dating 
              and then wants you to fix it: &#8220;Guys, start asking girls out! 
              - Girls, stop being so ugly! &#8211; Don&#8217;t be workaholics! 
              &#8211; PC culture is the devil! &#8211; Blah blah blah.&#8221; 
              All these writers ever succeed in doing is either completely depressing 
              us so we never wanting to date again, or slamming so many commands 
              down our throat we are left staring at the paper thinking: &#8220;Why 
              should I listen to you?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">In the end, our dating scene isn&#8217;t 
              much to worry about. Look at it this way, would you want all the 
              weirdo men who are insecure with themselves to start asking random 
              girls on dates? Would it be better if every girl at Stanford took 
              the initiative and asked out all of the passive guys? I&#8217;m 
              going to have to go with no on this one. All the people that don&#8217;t 
              want to go on dates don&#8217;t have to, and those that want some 
              more excitement in their life are probably already dating. A generally 
              overlooked point is that for those of us that want to date, the 
              environment at Stanford makes it much more likely that our offer 
              will be accepted. All the articles in the world aren&#8217;t going 
              to change your mind about dating. Now that you know the Top Four 
              reasons Stanford students don&#8217;t date, you don&#8217;t need 
              to read all those other peoples&#8217; one-sided, good-for-nothing 
              articles in the first place &#8211; Stanford dating is fine just 
              the way it is.
