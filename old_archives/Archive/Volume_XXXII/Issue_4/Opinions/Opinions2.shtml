          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Spring 
              quarter at Stanford is undoubtedly the best reason for being at 
              this school. The weather is great, the quarter is short, people 
              take light course loads, there are a plethora of social functions, 
              and to start it all off with a bang is Greek Rush. Both sororities 
              and fraternities have rush over the course of the first three weeks 
              of spring quarter, bringing excitement and energy to all those involved 
              in the Greek system and its prospective members. However, the turnout 
              for rush events this year was significantly down from last year. 
              IFC figures put the approximate number of freshman rushing fraternities 
              as down 25% from last spring &#8211; an unusually large variation.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The fraternities have been doing 
              the same thing this year as they do every year, but the turnout 
              is down. What then is the cause of this decreased interest? It seems 
              to be the continuation of a recent trend of social degradation on 
              this campus. It almost seems as if every time I pick up an issue 
              of The Daily another organization has been placed on alcohol probation. 
              From the Stanford Band&#8217;s ridiculous three-year probation to 
              Delta Delta Delta&#8217;s that will last until 2006, it appears 
              that university officials have gone &#8220;probation crazy&#8221;. 
              For those of you who were here last year, you may remember that 
              most of the housed fraternities were on probation at some point 
              during the year.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Of course, one cannot analyze 
              the recent drop-off in sociability of this campus without mentioning 
              the new alcohol policy that prohibits freshman dorms from throwing 
              wet parties. It used to be that every weekend there would be several 
              parties each night, with a freshman dorm such as Otero, Cedro, or 
              Branner hosting at least one of them. Now, however, fraternities 
              host nearly all the parties, and since most fraternities are already 
              having all the parties they can afford and fit into their schedules, 
              the net result is a substantial drop-off in the number of parties 
              in general. In addition, this policy combination creates larger 
              crowds at the parties that do occur, leading to greater liability 
              and risk concerns for fraternities. It almost seems as if the university 
              had this in mind when devising their new alcohol policy. To add 
              insult to injury, the &#8220;deadline&#8221; for ending parties 
              is earlier every year. Two years ago, parties regularly went on 
              until 3 or 4 AM, but newly enforced &#8220;noise ordinances&#8221; 
              require that they end at 1.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">As mentioned two issues ago in 
              Evan Raff&#8217;s article on social ineptitude, one possible solution 
              to the problem would simply be to institute an interview in the 
              admissions process. This would, in theory, weed out the applicants 
              who are socially inept and thus leave a bad impression on the interviewers. 
              However, for this idea to work, the interviewer would have to be 
              looking for sociable people, and if the university is in fact trying 
              to repress the social atmosphere of the campus, it would obviously 
              not encourage positive evaluations of anyone who advertised even 
              a remote interest in alcohol consumption. Even the police officers 
              lament the current situation. Upon asking one officer who wished 
              to remain anonymous what he thought of the recent crackdown, he 
              replied, &#8220;It was much better in the past. I enjoying seeing 
              you guys have fun, and I hate having to be so tough on you all.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It is no wonder rush is down from 
              previous years. The campus in general has become lamer and less 
              interesting. With fewer parties happening, freshmen are exposed 
              to less people, don&#8217;t come out of their shells as much, and 
              tend to be less social in general. All of these factors lead to 
              a smaller group of freshman guys who are actually interested in 
              becoming part of the Greek system at Stanford, which is quickly 
              becoming the last bastion of social activity on this campus. It 
              is obvious to everyone what is happening, yet the student body has 
              done nothing to correct the changes being made. You have a voice, 
              and I encourage you all to speak out. I put it you to, Stanford 
              University, as we spend this spring quarter together, be proud of 
              who you are! Protest something that directly affects you. In a show 
              of student solidarity, throw a kegger in White Plaza and protest 
              the social oppression that is rampant at this university! We need 
              to send a strong message to the powers that be and end this downward 
              trend once and for all.<br>
