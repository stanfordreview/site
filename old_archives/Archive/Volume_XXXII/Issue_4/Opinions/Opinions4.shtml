          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Living 
              on a college campus brings with it a special uniqueness. Everyday 
              smiling people go to class, a friendly and youthful atmosphere pervades 
              the beautiful surroundings and every other week one is greeted by 
              the jeers of another activist group chanting a protest &#8220;song.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Acts of protest and civil disobedience 
              have a long history. Most commonly we look at Gandhi&#8217;s use 
              of civil disobedience to facilitate India&#8217;s independence, 
              but protest has long been the trigger for political change from 
              America to France. But what did these protests that initiated such 
              profound social and political change have in common that today&#8217;s 
              protests completely lack? Effectiveness.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">When Americans wanted to protest 
              the Tea Act of 1773, they dumped 10,000 pounds worth of tea into 
              the ocean. When Gandhi wanted to protest the British Salt Tax which 
              gave Britain a monopoly on salt production, he led a group of protestors 
              to defy the law by collecting salt on their own. When the Stanford 
              Coalition for Peace and Justice wanted to stop the war in Iraq, 
              they blocked traffic in San Francisco. Is it any wonder why Stanford 
              activist groups rarely forward their stated objectives?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">An effective protest is marked 
              by dedication, resolve, maturity and most importantly a demonstrable 
              point. The agenda of the protest must be readily self-evident from 
              the process. These days, it is more common to see someone with a 
              microphone in White Plaza whose net effect is a small surrounding 
              group of people wondering &#8220;I wonder what these guys are protesting?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The most common justification 
              for these protests is that they &#8220;spread awareness.&#8221; 
              But if the goal is really to &#8220;spread awareness&#8221;, these 
              groups need do little more than hand out copies of the Washington 
              Times for students to education themselves with. Furthermore, the 
              flyers that these protests proliferate under the guise of &#8220;spreading 
              awareness&#8221; are usually a half-page of biased news bytes full 
              of misinformation.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It is time Stanford comes to grips 
              with its own protest culture. The war in Iraq, Patriot Act, and 
              worker conditions are all serious issues that warrant a serious 
              addressing. Yet, these complex issues rarely receive more than the 
              knee-jerk emotional responses of a few that appear to be more interested 
              in living out a 1960&#8217;s fantasy than developing real world 
              solutions to real problems. Contorting a child&#8217;s rhyme into 
              &#8220;Bush and Condi sitting in a tree, K-I-L-L-I-N-G&#8221; not 
              only fails to promote a cause but in fact undermines it by underscoring 
              the pettiness of those engaging in the protest.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The acts of our protest community 
              dishonor these causes through both their lack of sincerity and ineffective 
              presentations. To truly be a University of higher thought, Stanford 
              must no longer allow dishonest groups to spearhead Stanford&#8217;s 
              engagement of such pressing political issues.
