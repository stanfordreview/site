              students sent a resounding message in the recent ASSU elections: 
              racism in any form will not be tolerated. For years, the Review 
              has worked to spread the truth about MEChA&#8217;s origins and the 
              racist ideology embodied in their founding documents. One needs 
              do little more than read the &#8220;El Plan Espiritual de Aztl&aacute;n&#8221; 
              to find a sampling of outrageous quotes such as &#8220;For the race 
              everything, for those outside, nothing&#8221; and, in regards to 
              the guiding purpose of MEChA, &#8220;Self-Defense against the occupying 
              forces of the oppressors at every school, every available man, woman, 
              and child.&#8221; It should also be noted that &#8220;El Plan&#8221; 
              also includes the &#8220;liberation&#8221; of the southwestern United 
              States and the return of that land to its historical heirs, Chicanos. 
              In studying MEChA&#8217;s history, it is clear that its primary 
              intent was never to combat social inequity, but rather to promote 
              racial exclusivity and a radical, subversive agenda.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">This is not to say the current 
              membership of Stanford&#8217;s MEChA chapters adheres to these objectives. 
              Today&#8217;s MEChA chapter is obviously not nearly as vocal in 
              such racist and outrageous goals. But regardless of whether MEChA 
              is simply silent about these historical objectives or has genuinely 
              lost interest in them, it has yet to renounce its racist underpinnings. 
              This alone should be a rallying call to every student who is dedicated 
              to opposing racism of all forms to remove financial support for 
              MEChA.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">And that&#8217;s exactly what 
              Stanford students did. We as a community should be proud. For all 
              the protests and energy the community spends on promoting socially 
              progressive ideals, something very material has been achieved and 
              one racist group has been stopped dead in its tracks.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">There has been collateral damage. 
              MEChA has strategically positioned itself as the center of funding 
              for many other Latino-related clubs. These groups receive a small 
              portion of the funding allocated to MEChA. In addition to the Review&#8217;s 
              editorials urging an end to MEChA, the Review has also called for 
              the smaller clubs that receive funding via MEChA to find alternative 
              routes of financing. Most of these smaller groups have no racist 
              history and their merits should be judged independently of MEChA 
              at large.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The radicalism that underpins 
              MEChA has finally caught up with it. Yet the penalty to be paid 
              will come at the cost of many arguably innocent groups. The only 
              way to guarantee that such a situation never arises again is for 
              these groups to renounce MEChA as a source of funding.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If Latino clubs continue to allow 
              their financial stability to rest on such a broken foundation, they 
              too will be haunted by the bigotry that lies in MEChA&#8217;s history. 
              If the community expects to have a well-funded future, it must take 
              a step away from MEChA and begin to build a new foundation that 
              is not rooted in racial hatred. </td>
