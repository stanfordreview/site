          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Spearheading 
              the anti-war effort at Stanford University, the Stanford Coalition 
              for Peace and Justice is one of Stanford&#8217;s most pronounced 
              activist groups. Over a year ago on the eve of the war in Iraq, 
              the Stanford Coalition for Peace and Justice (SCPJ) organized a 
              group of Stanford students to conduct an anti-war protest in San 
              Francisco. A year later, one of the protestors is sharing his insight 
              on the effectiveness of the protest and what SCPJ actually accomplished. 
              Junior Harvir Singh joins us to shed some light on the protest.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: Harvir, before we get 
              into the issues here, I was hoping you could provide a context for 
              where your political views lie on the traditional ideological spectrum.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: Let me be clear. I oppose 
              Bush&#8217;s foreign policy in almost every way possible. I think 
              the war in Iraq was misguided, unjust, unnecessary, and for all 
              the wrong reasons. In fact, most of the opinions presented by the 
              Review I vehemently contest.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: So it&#8217;s safe to 
              say you&#8217;re not conservative per se. How did you get involved 
              in SCPJ&#8217;s protest?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: An avid anti-war supporter, 
              the day after Bush dropped bombs in Iraq I was whisked away with 
              a group of Stanford students to San Francisco intent on participating 
              in one of the largest anti-war protests in decades. Fueled by a 
              powerful desire to stop the war at any cost, I and a hundred fifty 
              Stanford students marched the city, blocking the major intersection 
              of 3rd and Folsom.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: That must have been an 
              interesting experience to say the least.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: My experience that day 
              was no less than spectacular. As I stood there in the middle of 
              the crosswalk and looked down the two streets of the intersection, 
              literally hundreds of cars were packed in for over a city block. 
              Cars upon cars piled up at the intersection and were blocked as 
              far as we could see behind. Honking, singing, chanting, yelling, 
              were all interspersed into one noise: &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no 
              power like the power of the people cause the power of the people 
              don&#8217;t stop! Say WHAT?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Indeed, a group of students that 
              day had the power to halt the normal lives of thousands of people. 
              Combined with the rest of the populace that was protesting, we managed 
              to shut down hundreds of San Francisco businesses. But as I was 
              standing there that day, sometime between chanting furiously and 
              being dragged away by several police officers, a subtle but powerful 
              thought popped up in my mind. Then it came again, and again, and 
              again, until I was continuously plagued with the thought: &#8220;Will 
              what we do here today stop the war?&#8221; And repeatedly my mind 
              told me, to my dismay: &#8220;No, No, No!&#8221; Suddenly a tremendous 
              sense of uselessness overtook me as I came to this realization. 
              No amount of protesting we do here today will stop the bombs being 
              dropped over Baghdad.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">As this feeling of uselessness 
              lingered, I started observing closely the cars we had jammed on 
              the road. Some individuals stood outside their cars, observing our 
              actions no doubt with anger. Some scowled at us, some sat patiently 
              in their cars. All were eager to get back to their jobs and tasks 
              for the day. A series of questions slipped into my thoughts. &#8220;What 
              if we&#8217;re preventing someone in the traffic from getting their 
              cancer therapy? What if some pregnant lady can&#8217;t get to the 
              hospital right now? What if that guy has a life changing job interview 
              or that lady urgently needs to make an appointment?&#8221; 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Suddenly I realized that by standing 
              here in the middle of the intersection, preventing so many people 
              from going on with their daily lives (some of whom probably shared 
              our sentiments), we were probably doing a great deal more harm than 
              good.There&#8217;s an adage from South Asia that I often remind 
              myself of and try to live by: &#8220;If I can&#8217;t do anything 
              useful, at least I would like to do as little harm as possible.&#8221; 
              And here I was, sitting in the middle of one of the biggest intersections 
              in SF, being utterly useless, and doing a great deal of harm.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: So all in all, how do 
              you feel about the protest? How effective do you feel this protest 
              was in advancing SCPJ&#8217;s goal of stopping the war in Iraq?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: Looking back on that day, 
              I ask myself what we did manage to accomplish. One thing that comes 
              to mind is that we did totally disable the city&#8217;s public transportation 
              system. All the public buses were used to shuttle the thousands 
              of protesters from the streets to the police stations and city docks 
              (where the overflow went). But again, halting the activity of an 
              entire city for one day did nothing to stop the ongoing war in Iraq.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: Looking back, do you 
              have any critiques of your actions or of the protest group at large?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: One problem I think is 
              that most of us who participated in the protest that day, including 
              myself, got carried away by our emotions. Needless to say the crowd 
              was incredibly emotionally charged. The awe of the experience only 
              heightened our feelings. As I observed the hype and excitement I 
              started wondering why many of the students were here. Did they truly 
              understand the magnitude of the event? Did they truly oppose the 
              war? Or were some of them here simply to experience what it was 
              like to protest for the sake of protesting and causing mayhem? No 
              doubt many, including myself, believed in the cause. We wanted to 
              stop the war. But as I conversed with and observed the hype of the 
              other students, I felt many did not truly understand why they were 
              standing there on that day. Caught up in their emotions and excitement 
              they joined the bandwagon just for the sake of protesting.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: What effect did all that 
              charged emotion have on the group&#8217;s collective judgment and 
              decision making processes?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: A natural result of being 
              so emotionally charged is a loss of reason and judgment. In hindsight, 
              obviously, preventing people from going to their jobs and creating 
              traffic jams is not going to change the political situation. No 
              doubt, we could not realize this, since we were so caught up in 
              the hype and excitement. We simply did not think of what impact 
              this action would truly have. The civil disobedience of Gandhi succeeded 
              because he knew how and when to react to a situation, rationally 
              and reasonably. He also believed without hesitance in his cause 
              and was willing to die for it. Our civil disobedience failed not 
              only because we simply did not think rationally, but because many 
              of us did not even believe in the cause and were there simply for 
              the experience. Finally, how many of us were actually willing to 
              die for this? I certainly wasn&#8217;t.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: Many argue that most 
              college protestors believe less in their cause than in protest itself. 
              Where do you feel the impetus for this protest originated from?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: It seems to me this is 
              a symptom of a bigger issue. Students at college campuses all across 
              the nation have an ideal notion of the concept of civil disobedience. 
              Ever since our high school U.S. history class, we&#8217;ve revered 
              civil disobedience as the best vehicle for social change. As a result, 
              all of us at one point or another want to participate in a protest. 
              We want to experience first hand the methods that have created great 
              change. The problem is that we don&#8217;t truly understand how 
              to participate. Overcome by emotion, not really believing in a cause, 
              and protesting only for the sake of the experience, being useless 
              and ultimately causing only harm: this is not the way to social 
              change.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: Any thoughts as to how 
              SCPJ and Stanford&#8217;s many other activist groups could advocate 
              or protest for their causes more effectively?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Harvir: So, how do we make protesting 
              more effective? I&#8217;m not really sure of the answer to that, 
              and I&#8217;m not really sure it&#8217;s possible with such an emotionally 
              charged group of students and individuals across the nation. The 
              only advice I would give protestors now is, as long as you&#8217;re 
              going to be useless, at least you can try to do as little harm as 
              possible.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stephen: Thank you.
