          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Students 
              and community members gathered in White Plaza on Thursday, March 
              4th to protest both the ideology and funding of the past year&#8217;s 
              invasion of Iraq by the Bush administration. At Stanford and schools 
              around the world, student groups held coordinated rallies entitled 
              &#8220;Books Not Bombs II&#8221; to follow 2003&#8217;s protest 
              of looming war, highlighting the negative effects of military intervention 
              and the need to channel resources to domestic issues instead.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The protest dominated White Plaza 
              by mid-morning. Though the speeches did not commence until noon, 
              booths provided activities, petitions, information, and sales. The 
              primary event planners, the Stanford Community for Peace and Justice, 
              distributed green armbands as symbol of peace. A pie-eating contest 
              hosted by Sigma Nu and Kappa Kappa Gamma raised funds for the Boys 
              and Girls Club, Midnight Breakfast passed out tickets, and the Concert 
              Network sold passes to a punk rock show.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Enthusiasm and determination marked 
              the majority of participants, and many toted signs and encouraged 
              discussion. The crowd was full but not packed, comprised partially 
              of travelers between classes. Official support came from many groups 
              through the collaborative Coalition for Students Against War, which 
              includes the Hellenic Association, the Greens, American Indian Organization, 
              NAACP, Students for Fair Trade, Catholic Social Action, MEChA, Asian 
              American Students Association, Black and Queer at Stanford, Muslim 
              Students Awareness, Pilipino American Student Union, Querillas, 
              SCPJ, Resistance Art and Social Protest, Labor Action Coalition, 
              Environmental Action, and Youth Communist League, to name about 
              half of the membership.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Advertisements for the rally and 
              SCPJ&#8217;s website list motives for opposition to both this war 
              and general violence and injustice. As of February 29th, 2004, the 
              body count of those Iraqi casualties identified by their full or 
              partial name numbered 692, with total estimates between 8,000 and 
              11,000 dead and thousands more injured. Human rights advocates allege 
              unfair treatment by the United States of both prisoners at Guantanamo 
              Bay and those of Middle Eastern, South Asian, or North African descent 
              as a result of the Patriot Act.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Books Not Bombs organizers wish 
              to see public money from taxes spent on public education before 
              war, and the Coalition cites escalating Pentagon expenditures as 
              an impediment to meeting standards established in 2001 by Bush&#8217;s 
              No Child Left Behind. The failure of schools, especially in inner 
              cities and poorer areas, often correlates with higher incarceration 
              rates among youth. The flyer for the centralized rally efforts of 
              the National Youth &amp; Student Peace Coalition points out that, 
              &#8220;there&#8217;s always enough money for building weapons of 
              mass destruction and for locking up young people, but there&#8217;s 
              somehow never enough for education.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford 
              opened, followed by Marc Bamuthi Joseph, an adamant spoken word 
              artist and winner of San Francisco&#8217;s Poetry Grand Slam. His 
              performance, claiming that &#8220;we the people - do not feel any 
              safer&#8221; with &#8220;cats still pimping Christ&#8221; and &#8220;reliving 
              the Crusades one thousand years later,&#8221; elicited cheers and 
              affirmations. Janitorial staff member Doroteo Garcia blamed refusals 
              to increase worker pay and benefits on a struggling economy, and 
              Senior Sofia Lee led forcefully with a megaphone, calling for crowd 
              support by chanting.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">2003 Graduate Kuusela Halo attributed 
              the perils of the Philippines to U.S. imperialism. Professor Philip 
              Zimbardo explored the psychology of what he sees as Bush&#8217;s 
              fear tactics.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Attacks on Bush heightened with 
              choruses of &#8220;Bush and Condi, sittin&#8217; in a tree: K-I-L-L-I-N-G!&#8221; 
              Condoleeza Rice, Assistant to the President for National Security 
              Affairs, has been a member of the Stanford community via the Hoover 
              Institute since 1981, served as provost for six years, and is now 
              tenured in Stanford&#8217;s political science department. She is 
              also the target of much anti-war criticism, especially since she 
              was a vocal proponent of the supposition that Saddam Hussein was 
              harboring WMD.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Anger at Stanford&#8217;s Hoover 
              Institution, from which eight Fellows aid Bush on the Defense Policy 
              Board, continued the sentiments of last year&#8217;s rally. SCPJ 
              was then in the midst of waging a campaign to separate the conservative 
              think tank from Stanford, which they claim is wrong in lending &#8220;an 
              aura of academic credibility&#8221; to a group of scholars hired 
              with attention to their political beliefs. They see the association 
              of the two respectable institutions as violating &#8220;academic 
              freedom,&#8221; and an AlternaFund is in place in hopes that donors 
              will set aside planned financial gifts until Stanford renounces 
              a supposedly &#8220;conservatively biased&#8221; institution.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Students marched past the main 
              quad to Hoover Tower, shaking fists and chanting, &#8220;Whose war? 
              Hoover&#8217;s War!&#8221; Alternative classes taught after the 
              rally addressed notoriously liberal perspectives on current global 
              affairs. A candlelight vigil ended the day&#8217;s events.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">On the eve of war in March 2003, 
              last year&#8217;s rally saw heated opposition to U.S. intervention 
              and questioned the existence of WMD and the legitimacy of preemptive 
              attack. The rally was a &#8220;student strike,&#8221; for which 
              24 professors canceled class and attendance numbered roughly 1000. 
              This year&#8217;s attendance was down, and Daily writers Courtney 
              Brigham and Caroline Ciccone, in a March 5, 2004 Editorial, asked 
              &#8220;what exactly&#8221; the rally was protesting, since the war 
              has already occurred. Activists&#8217; efforts now focus more on 
              electing Kerry in 2004 instead of Bush.
