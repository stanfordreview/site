        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">Undergraduates 
              voted against giving MEChA, a Chicano group whose literature the 
              Review exposed as racist in October, special fees of about $40,000 
              for the 2004-2005 school year.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The special fee has traditionally 
              covered a host of Chicano/Latino events on campus beyond just MEChA 
              activities, including El Dia de los Muertos, the Cinco de Mayo Celebration, 
              International Women&#8217;s Day Panel, Raza Day High School Conference, 
              and Cesar Chavez Commemoration.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The ASSU voter&#8217;s guide lists 
              the total MEChA budget at over $100,000, with about 60% of the funds 
              coming from academic departments, El Centro Chicano, and the Stanford 
              Fund.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The largest line item of the budget 
              is honoraria for speakers like Cruz Bustamante and Jesse Jackson.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The MEChA special fee got 1329 
              votes, but there were 1357 votes against the special fee, making 
              MEChA the group with the highest percentage of votes below the 50% 
              cutoff. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The investigative report and editorial 
              on MEChA by the Review earlier in the year are widely thought to 
              have swayed the vote.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The Oct. 13 editorial states &#8220;Stanford 
              MEChA currently receives more than $40,000 per year in special fees 
              from Stanford students through the ASSU. We wonder what percentage 
              of the student body that voted for MEChA specials fees knew of the 
              racism embedded within its founding documents.&#8221; The offending 
              documents are still on the MEChA web site in the &#8220;about&#8221; 
              section, with no disclaimer.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Neither the editorial nor the 
              investigative piece accused students in Stanford MEChA of racism, 
              but rather called on them to reject the racism of their documents 
              and the national network of MEChA.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">As the Review called on MEChA 
              not to stop its activism or existence, but rather to renounce its 
              racist links, the rejection of the special fee is seen by many as 
              a concurrence of the student body that MEChA should rethink its 
              ties before next year&#8217;s elections.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Having received ASSU special fees 
              for many years, MEChA was expected to easily win approval for its 
              budget. The unexpected upset has surprised and shocked many MEChA 
              members. One MEChA member, Alida Garcia, who was arrested by the 
              police in 2001 for trespassing during a protest against labor subcontracting 
              by the Stanford Hospital, appeared particularly alarmed at the outcome 
              of the election.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Currently serving as the Assistant 
              Elections Commissioner for the ASSU, Alida Garcia was quoted in 
              the Daily as saying &#8220;Ya&#8217;ll suck for that [voting against 
              the MEChA special fee], personally&#8221; immediately after she 
              officially announced the special fees results for MEChA.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">However, many students were satisfied 
              with the vote. Junior Sam Chang said, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s 
              a good thing that people are starting to look at where their special 
              fees are going. I think that if MEChA wants to receive special fee 
              funding in the future it should rethink the services that it directly 
              provides to the community.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">&#8221;MEChA has faced a growing 
              concern amongst the Stanford student body that it is an organization 
              linked to racism. The historical document most commonly cited as 
              evidence of MEChA&#8217;s historical ties to racism is &#8220;El 
              Plan de Aztl&aacute;n.&#8221; This organizational blueprint for 
              MEChA dates back to the late 60&#8217;s. Its text outlines organizational 
              objectives including the &#8220;liberation&#8221; of the southwestern 
              United States and its return to the Chicano community. The co-chairs 
              of MEChA as well as the director of El Centro Chicano failed to 
              return e-mails from the Review.
