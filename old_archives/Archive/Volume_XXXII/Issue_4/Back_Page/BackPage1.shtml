          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">The 
              sun was rising on yet another beautiful day at Stanford University. 
              Awaking from peaceful slumbers in their respective rooms, Stephen 
              and David arose to find the latest issue of The Stanford Daily on 
              their doorstep. After glancing over the headlines, they turned to 
              their favourite column, Fireside Chats with Courtney Brigham and 
              Caroline Ciccone. While perusing the article, they quickly realized 
              that it was talking about them! Excited at the prospect of some 
              form of positive recognition, the two Review writers grew giddy. 
              However, after reading a few more sentences, they realized with 
              the utmost dismay that the article was in fact mocking them. Imagine 
              their horror, being made fun of by the two columnists whom they 
              adored most by means of personal, physically descriptive and demeaning 
              attacks. After the initial shock had passed, David and Stephen devised 
              a plan to win over the hearts of the twin beauties Courtney and 
              Caroline so that their existence would finally be validated.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The two young and dashing editors 
              thought for hours about the best way to improve their standing with 
              the two columnists and then came a brilliant idea. They would take 
              the two girls out to dinner, wine them and dine them until they 
              were convinced that the Review wasn&#8217;t so bad after all. With 
              a swarm of butterflies in his stomach, Stephen picked up his phone, 
              dialed Courtney&#8217;s number, and held his breath. &#8220;Hello?&#8221;, 
              she picked up. &#8220;Hey, this is Stephen Cohen, the Editor of 
              the Stanford Review.&#8221; Courtney replied in surprise, &#8220;Oh&#8230;hello. 
              What&#8217;s up?&#8221; Stephen responded, &#8220;Yeah... I just 
              read your article in The Daily about Dave and me, and we thought 
              it would be a good idea to take you and Caroline out to dinner to, 
              you know, talk about things.&#8221; Hesitant but deeply intrigued, 
              Courtney replied, &#8220;Sure,&#8221; hoping to take advantage of 
              the situation to garner more material with which to blast the Review&#8217;s 
              staff. Relieved and excited, Stephen called David. Emanating a sense 
              of pride and accomplishment Stephen said, &#8220;We just got a date 
              with Courtney and Caroline. Let&#8217;s work this one to our advantage. 
              Afterall, who can resist our intellectual cunning and conservative 
              charm?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The next week, the date was settled. 
              With an 8:30 res. at Trader Vic&#8217;s on Friday, the two editors 
              were confident that they would have a successful night. However, 
              when Stephen and David first met up with the two lovely ladies, 
              there was somewhat of a confrontation. Apparently, Courtney and 
              Caroline still had some pent up aggression against the two editors 
              that needed release. In one particularly wild fit of rage, the two 
              girls picked up some nearby golf clubs and started violently beating 
              Stephen and David. Their hatred of newspaper editors with small 
              members and rat-tails infusing their arms with ungodly power, the 
              girls swung at the two men violently. However, with a show of force 
              and some much-needed moderation by outside parties, the flogging 
              halted and order was restored.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">With a ceasefire established, 
              the Reviewers drove the two exquisite beauties to the restaurant, 
              and the night truly began. Although the conversation was somewhat 
              antagonistic at first, Stephen wisely ordered a Scorpion Bowl, a 
              concoction not unlike the magical tea in the film Zoolander, and 
              everyone bagan to loosen up a bit. After consuming several more 
              of the deadly libations, time began to blur. The group quickly found 
              themselves laughing at each other&#8217;s remarks and enjoying themselves 
              immensely. All animosity seemed to disappear and the two pairs developed 
              a new affinity for each other. After several courses and a rather 
              large bill, Stephen and David decided to bring the party back to 
              Stanford.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">What ensued was a joyous and unprecedented 
              conciliation. After a few minutes of idle banter, the real fun began. 
              The room grew dim and only silhouettes could be seen. I can ensure 
              you, dear reader, that a good time was had by all. The next morning, 
              as the sun once again rose upon Stanford University, Stephen and 
              David awoke with smiles on their faces, knowing that they had done 
              well. They had confronted their opponents, turned them in the Right 
              direction, and, most importantly, seduced them. With another two 
              conversions under their belts, Stephen and David turned their eyes 
              to their next target: Daily Columnist and Review-hater yet nonetheless 
              lovely specimen of the female species, Julie Ruvolo.
