              most people, February 14th is a day saturated with hearts, flowers, 
              cupids and chocolates. But for the fifth year at Stanford, many 
              students have associated Valentine&#8217;s Day with something a 
              little less idyllic; the Vagina Monologues. The two hour theatrical 
              piece, created by activist Eve Ensler, was showcased by undergraduates 
              on Friday and Saturday nights. Both productions of the monologues 
              sold out or nearly sold out Dinkelspiel Auditorium. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The all-female cast of seventeen 
              performed the approximately twenty monologues which all revolved 
              around awareness of womanhood in both an abstract and a very physical 
              sense. Many of the monologues openly and comically discussed topics 
              such as masturbation, menstruation, pubic hair and vaginal discharge. 
              Despite the callous nature of these subjects, the comedy was well 
              received by the primarily female audience. This may have been in 
              part because much of the humor was at the expense of their male 
              counterparts. One narrator scoffs at the number of nerves in the 
              penis in comparison to the clitoris by stating &#8220;Who needs 
              a handgun when you have a semi-automatic.&#8221; Also, the sexual 
              mishaps of men are too easily converted to jokes such as &#8220;If 
              it could talk, what would your vagina say? ... Slow Down!! ... Where&#8217;s 
              Brian? ... Don&#8217;t give up!&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The Vagina Monologues was littered 
              with many vivid statements some have called &#8220;anti-man.&#8221; 
              In one instance, the narrator recounts an episode from grade school 
              where she is punched by a ten year old boy in the crotch, &#8220;I 
              limp home. I can&#8217;t pee.&#8221; The audience was also thoroughly 
              amused by a response to the question &#8220;If your vagina could 
              wear anything, what would your vagina wear? An electrical shock 
              device to keep unwanted visitors away!&#8221; Supporters say these 
              statements are simply an attempt to stop the violence perpetuated 
              against women.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Though much of the material was 
              based on the comedy of what it means to be a woman, the serious 
              topics of violence, rape, incest, and abuse were raised in graphic 
              detail. A new addition to the monologues this year included the 
              chilling account of one of the five hundred women who have been 
              acid burned by their families in Islamabad. Another story is told 
              from the perspective of a Kosovar refugee who describes how her 
              feelings about her vagina drastically changed after six Serbian 
              soldiers raped her for nearly a week. All of the Vagina Monologue&#8217;s 
              stories of rape and abuse are so incredibly sobering that one cannot 
              leave the auditorium without understanding why Eve Ensler, a victim 
              of rape herself, strives to push these issues to forefront of social 
              awareness.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Criticism for Eve Ensler&#8217;s 
              piece is derived more from some of the less serious monologues. 
              Many critics feel one monologue which encourages the audiences to 
              chant the word &#8220;c-nt,&#8221; does little to empower women 
              and only serves to dilute the more important message of believing 
              that one&#8217;s vagina is a thing of beauty and an embodiment of 
              oneself. In addition, the same critics contend that the topic of 
              lesbianism, though critical to mention, should not be broached in 
              the context of a relationship between a child and an adult, even 
              if both parties are female. This reference to child abuse in a positive 
              light is a major part of the monologue, The Little Coochi Sorcher 
              That Could. Critics cite the constant emphasis on sexuality combined 
              with a lack of discussion about abstinence or even contraception, 
              making the Vagina Monologues especially offensive to most conservatives. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Furthermore, there has been a 
              national outcry over the use of state funds to put on the Vagina 
              Monologues at some public colleges. Unlike other campuses, the Vagina 
              Monologues at Stanford were not financed by the University with 
              the exception of a $1500 grant from the ASSU to help cover production 
              costs. The production of the Vagina Monologues and the Stanford 
              V-Day campaign does not receive special fees funding. However, the 
              Vagina Monologues, as part of the nationwide V-Day campaign, are 
              required to be able to raise $6000 for charities which serve to 
              aid battered women or raise awareness of violence against women. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The Stanford V-Day campaign hopes 
              their donations will exceed $7000 from ticket sales and corporate 
              and residence sponsorship.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stanford students were charged 
              $7 while others were charged $12 to attend the monologues. About 
              fifteen dorms, including the Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma fraternities 
              and the Inter-sorority council, sponsored the event, with donations 
              ranging from $50 to $100. Ten percent of this year&#8217;s proceeds 
              will go to the V-Day campaign to stop the abduction and rape of 
              women in Juarez, Mexico. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The additional bulk of the money 
              raised will be donated to Menlo Park Rape Trauma Services.
