              president is a moron. The president is not in control of anything.&#8221; 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">So says Harley Schlanger, Lyndon 
              LaRouche&#8217;s western state spokesman. Lyndon LaRouche, a presidential 
              candidate in every presidential election year since 1976, has been 
              highly critical of the Bush administration. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mr. LaRouche believes that Mr. 
              Bush&#8217;s economic policies have hurt the dollar on the world 
              currency market and vastly increased the federal deficit. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Like the other Democratic candidates, 
              he strongly disagrees with the preemptive war in Iraq. He is known 
              for the so-called &#8220;Children of Satan&#8221; pamphlets, which 
              outlined his disagreements with current policy and attempted to 
              link University of Chicago philosopher Leo Strauss to what one of 
              his supporters, Jeffrey Steinberg, calls &#8220;the neo-conservative 
              war party.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">In short, as one member of the 
              LaRouche Youth Movement put it, &#8220;We think the neo-cons are 
              Nazis.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Although the LaRouche campaign 
              has had very little success--one of the few highlights at the polls 
              was in 2000, when LaRouche won 22% of the vote in the Arkansas primary--he 
              still maintains that the &#8220;worst honest question&#8221; he 
              has been asked is, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just quit?&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The answer can be found in his 
              approach to the campaign. The &#8220;purpose of the campaign,&#8221; 
              says Mr. Schlanger, &#8220;is to change the policies of the United 
              States,&#8221; and he claims that the campaign has been successful 
              in that regard. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">He gives the LaRouche campaign 
              some of the credit for the emphasis placed on Cheney&#8217;s ties 
              to Halliburton and wrongdoings currently under investigation that 
              may have occurred while he was CEO of Halliburton.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Says Mr. Schlanger, &#8220;Cheney 
              is still lying. Cheney is still saying there are weapons of mass 
              destruction.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">LaRouche is critical of the education 
              system, saying &#8220;Today&#8217;s teachers have not necessarily 
              intended to educate or test their students in a manner suited to 
              human beings.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The Associated Press reported 
              that LaRouche accuses Queen Elizabeth II of dealing drugs on a large 
              scale.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Perhaps one of the most visible 
              elements of the LaRouche campaign is the use of interruptions during 
              venues in which other Democratic candidates are speaking, including 
              both nationally televised events, like the Congressional Black Caucus 
              debate, and local events, such as John Kerry&#8217;s speech on campus 
              in December.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Officially, the policy of the 
              campaign is, &#8220;We don&#8217;t interrupt speeches,&#8221; according 
              to Mr. Schlanger. Any disturbances come during the question and 
              answer periods rather than the speeches, generally where the format 
              is such that questions are screened prior to them being asked, since 
              &#8220;a lot of people feel constrained by that.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mr. LaRouche is trying to establish 
              an entire worldwide movement around his core beliefs. Mr. Schlanger 
              says that they are targeting young people because they look for 
              &#8220;people who have not already made compromise, are not locked 
              in, and have the capacity to meet certain judgments.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mr. LaRouche has run for president 
              in every presidential election year since 1976, and as a Democrat 
              every election year since 1980 (in 1976 he ran for the Labor party). 
              Even his 5-year stay behind bars on a fraud conviction did not stop 
              him from running in 1992.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">During LaRouche&#8217;s many runs 
              at the presidential nomination, he has continually warned about 
              different types of collapses that he believes are imminent. Mr. 
              Schlanger said that LaRouche has been right in at least one instance--in 
              2000, when LaRouche warned that the dot-com bubble was on the verge 
              of collapsing.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Mr. LaRouche was the keynote speaker 
              at the ICLC/Schiller Institute President&#8217;s Day Conference 
              on February 14, which he predicted, in an open letter to the Democratic 
              National Committee, will be &#8220;the most important political 
              address to have been given anywhere in the world, by anyone, in 
              more than a century to date.&#8221;<br>
