        <tr valign="top"> 
          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">With 
              banners in White Plaza, &#8220;rape free zone&#8221; tape around 
              the row houses, and blue ribbons about the post office, it is that 
              time of year again; no not Valentine&#8217;s Day, but Vagina Monologues 
              Day. The purported point of all of this is to &#8220;Stop Violence 
              Against Women.&#8221; 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">But how does a production that 
              calls for audience participation in screaming &#8220;c-nt&#8221; 
              stop violence against women? How does the story of the &#8220;Little 
              Coochi Sorcher That Could&#8221; in which pedophilic molestation 
              against a previously assaulted 13 year old girl is morally equivocated 
              as a sexual growing experience do anything to reduce violence against 
              women? The answer is that it does not.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If &#8220;V-Week&#8221; was really 
              about the motto &#8220;Until the Violence Stops,&#8221; then there 
              would be discussions of tougher criminal penalties for rapists, 
              how to better reform the justice system to deal with sexual assault, 
              and if Megan&#8217;s Law went far enough. Instead, the week is marked 
              by exaggerated statistics meant to shock and expose a problem, without 
              ever presenting a solution. Even if one assumes the Vagina Monologues 
              production can really stop sexual assault against women, why isn&#8217;t 
              it marketed towards the audience who commits these crimes, men?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">While the Vagina Monologues fail 
              to properly address issues of rape, they succeed in creating an 
              amazingly potent anti-male presentation. With males depicted as 
              Serbian gang rapists and child molesters followed by lines such 
              as &#8220;I&#8217;ll never need to rely on a man&#8221; the anti-male 
              slant is undeniable. But certainly not all males are rapists. Moreover, 
              most women do need men, just as most men do need women. I fear that 
              the collective sense of women&#8217;s self-empowerment is coming 
              at the cost of a greater resentment and distrust for men in general.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Rape is unquestionably a terrible 
              crime. But if we are to properly address it, it will take the concentration 
              of people of both genders. Demonizing males everywhere for the crimes 
              of a handful only stifles the cooperation that must exist between 
              men and women if we hope to stop these outrageous crimes. The Vagina 
              Monologues only accentuates divisions on an issue where gender unity 
              is required. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Let the Stanford community be 
              honest with itself. This was never about stopping violence. This 
              is a week of hoorah female self-empowerment in which the taboos 
              surrounding genitalia are blown to bits by an outrageous production 
              that takes it way over the top. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Perhaps there is nothing wrong 
              with this. Perhaps the women of Stanford deserve a week to bask 
              in a collective spirit of female solidarity. But rape is a very 
              serious issue. It is a dire problem today&#8217;s society faces 
              and it will not be dispelled by female &#8220;self-empowerment.&#8221; 
              All the &#8220;rape free zone&#8221; tape in the world won&#8217;t 
              stop crime, screaming &#8220;c-nt&#8221; doesn&#8217;t scare a rapist, 
              and being in touch with one&#8217;s vagina doesn&#8217;t intimidate 
              a sexual predator. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">If the Stanford Community is truly 
              interested in preventing rape, surely we can find a better route 
              than the Vagina Monologues.
