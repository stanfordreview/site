              June, along with the University of Michigan, Stanford celebrated 
              the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to uphold affirmative action 
              practices throughout the nation. Stanford&#8217;s position of support 
              for this ruling is two-fold: not only do Stanford officials maintain 
              the questionable opinion that universities have an obligation to 
              help minorities by lowering admissions standards for them, but they 
              can always fall back on their concept that a more diverse student 
              body is beneficial to the entire academic community. Stanford claims 
              that by bringing minorities into the school, all students can benefit 
              from exposure to their diverse backgrounds. The school&#8217;s reliance 
              on this logic would be credible but for one glaring contradiction: 
              the segregation that is ethnic theme housing.<br>
              Stanford&#8217;s four ethnically themed residences - Ujamaa, Casa 
              Zapata, Okada, and Muwekma-tah-ruk - stand as symbols of segregation 
              that defy any notion that the University is truly interested in 
              a unified student body with diverse backgrounds. Instead, they represent 
              an institutionalized cloistering of minorities that reinforces the 
              idea that minorities truly are different from other people. If Stanford 
              will join the University of Michigan in an affirmative action battle 
              on the basis that exposure to different cultural backgrounds benefits 
              all students on campus, then it should not allow minorities to effectively 
              tell other students that they have a special need to be surrounded 
              by students who share their &#8220;differences&#8221;.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Not only does ethnic theme housing 
              encourage perceptions of minorities as distinctly different humans, 
              it also denies the true nature of a college experience to its residents. 
              Such a living arrangement discourages the exposure to diverse cultures 
              and ideas that Stanford&#8217;s diversity initiatives, such as affirmative 
              action, seek to promote. While Hispanic residents living in Casa 
              Zapata can immerse themselves in Hispanic culture and heritage, 
              it is questionable as to what motivation they would have to learn 
              about Asian culture, for example, when the programming in their 
              residence consistently celebrates only Hispanic culture. People 
              who are surrounded by others of their same background will feel 
              comfortable in that environment and will be understandably reluctant 
              to seek out new cultures and experiences. Exposure to new experiences, 
              cultures, and ideas is an integral part of the college experience, 
              and one that Stanford espouses with zeal. Therefore, any university 
              housing policy that supports the current situation must be questioned. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">When examining the relationship 
              between ethnic theme houses and the rest of campus, it is easy to 
              overlook the third party involved aa the non-minority students who 
              are assigned to live in ethnic theme houses. Many students in such 
              a situation feel socially and culturally ostracized. One sophomore 
              who lived in Ujamaa last year said, &#8220;Being forced to associate 
              myself with a culture was not my idea of a pleasurable experience.&#8221; 
              He claims that he felt clearly unaccepted by many of his fellow 
              residents and was forced to find a social network in the other residences 
              of Lagunita. Rather than being exposed to a diverse group of people, 
              this student felt forcibly immersed in one dominant culture, with 
              few outlets to other perspectives. It simply is not fair to deny 
              such students the diverse residential environment that most other 
              students are allowed to enjoy. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The University likes to remind 
              students that culturally-based residential programming is open to 
              all residents, not just those of the favored minority. The school 
              will contend that this facilitates the exposure to diverse backgrounds 
              that is the goal of its emphasis on diversity. The tragic irony 
              is, of course, not only that exposure is more forcible than might 
              be appropriate, but that this facilitation only works one way. Students 
              of ethnically themed dorms are denied the chance to experience the 
              great diversity that exists in most other dorms. Such students are 
              placed in an environment where they are encouraged to immerse themselves 
              only in the culture with which they are familiar. While there is 
              certainly nothing wrong with a support network being available for 
              ethnic students, immersion in this network should not be so intense 
              that it distances these students from other cultural experiences. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Furthermore, there is a problem 
              in the housing provided for these ethnically themed houses. While 
              Ujamaa, Okada, and Casa Zapata cannot be considered premier housing, 
              the fact that Native American students can be almost guaranteed 
              a spot in a house of supreme location such as Muwekma-tah-ruk based 
              simply on their race is truly unjust. The University is reluctant 
              to grant row housing to fraternities because this makes prime housing 
              exclusive and less available to the general student body. Yet, tragically, 
              the administration clearly has no trouble making housing exclusive 
              if it is exclusive on the basis of race. The fact that a student 
              can be virtually guaranteed such a premier housing assignment simply 
              because he or she is one-eighth Native American, while other students 
              must suffer through the housing draw without advantage, is an insult 
              to all Stanford students. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that 
              students with distant ancestors from a wide range of Indian tribes 
              really have any common cultural bond. The Native American tribes 
              who dominated North America centuries ago covered as broad a cultural 
              spectrum as the one found in America today. To set aside a superb 
              house such as Muwekma-tah-ruk under the auspices of a common cultural 
              theme is a farce, and one that has negative consequences for the 
              entire university. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Rather than support this segregation 
              of cultures from each other, Stanford should promote a unified student 
              body composed of diverse pieces. To go to such pains to create a 
              diverse student body and to then allow it to segment itself upon 
              arrival is counterproductive. Instead, Stanford should place all 
              students in similarly diverse situations. It has been argued that 
              minorities cannot handle the shock of being placed in a drastically 
              new environment and need the support of a culturally common residence. 
              This view devalues the individualism of these students. The reality 
              is that such a shock is the purpose of a college experience and 
              the reason it can be so enriching. Stanford should be challenging 
              minority students to confront new perspectives, rather than suggesting 
              that they are incapable of taking on such challenges and that they 
              should consider the safer alternative of an ethnic theme house. 
              Giving all students such a challenge would be the epitome of equality 
              and a celebration of the fact that people of all cultures can learn 
              much from each other. Instead, Stanford continues to promote a segregationist 
              housing policy that is detrimental to all Stanford students.
