              University is full of remarkable people whose accomplishments overflowed 
              into the margins on their applications, but as we all know, college 
              admissions officers often overemphasize factors like race and community 
              service while ignoring some of the most important characteristics 
              of a student&#8217;s portfolio: social skills. When most students 
              receive the fat envelope from Stanford, they do not anticipate a 
              social scene that competes with state schools, but they shouldn&#8217;t 
              have to contend with a campus full of socially incompetent geniuses.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">What has happened to the well-rounded 
              student who can juggle academic rigor and maintain some semblance 
              of personality? While parents, teachers, and admissions officers 
              praise academic achievements as the measure of success, students 
              know that this means little when trying to strike up a conversation 
              at the CoHo or sharing a laugh at a party on the Row. No one outside 
              your Chemistry and Math TA&#8217;s is impressed that you know the 
              atomic weight of Tungsten or can calculate an Eigenvalue, but everyone 
              can smile when you regale the room with a story of self-deprecation 
              or tell a joke and get to know your fellow classmates. Sadly, these 
              nuances of personality are lost on this campus of intrepid but awkward 
              young students, most of whom do not display the social skills needed 
              to get a date on a Friday night.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Here at Stanford, the evidence 
              of widespread social ineptitude is glaring. &#8220;The Stanford 
              Bubble&#8221; pertains not only to our big-campus mentality but 
              also to the majority of Stanford students who seem to be out of 
              touch with general social trends. Most people spend their time in 
              their rooms studying, and classes are filled with awkward discussions 
              in which people participate infrequently.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Personality concerns go past benign 
              interactions between students in the social scene. All people respond 
              better to those who are socially amiable and can communicate their 
              thoughts clearly. Professors and TA&#8217;s who are dynamic make 
              lectures more interesting and enjoyable. Accordingly, teachers will 
              respond to students who are socially apt and personable. Because 
              shyness and awkwardness are ubiquitous traits amongst the nerdy, 
              they are prolific at Stanford, but it is important to realize that 
              they benefit no one.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Despite Stanford students&#8217; 
              obsessions with being the best, they are ignoring a key component 
              of success. As countless professionals continue to preach, having 
              good social skills is one of the most important qualities for success 
              in the job market. Having social awareness and competency is as 
              or more important than &#8220;book smarts&#8221; in pursuing a career 
              in many fields, including business, law, and medicine. As any investment 
              banker will attest to, knowing the price-to-earnings ratio alone 
              will not seal the deal on Wall Street aa one must be able to impress 
              the client with a strong presentation and high confidence.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">One business-attuned Stanford 
              sophomore agrees: &#8220;There is much more to a complete student 
              than book smarts. I&#8217;m not surprised at all to discover that 
              some of the most successful businessmen have had mediocre academic 
              records in college.&#8221;
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">A key problem in the admissions 
              process is that it favors those who spent more time padding their 
              resumes than building relationships with friends. There is something 
              to be said for recruiting students with marketable characteristics 
              other than intelligence and the drive to succeed. Although Stanford 
              claims that an applicant&#8217;s personality comes through in their 
              essay, all those who wrote on such limited topics as &#8220;What&#8217;s 
              Your Favorite Academic Interest?&#8221; will testify that their 
              personality certainly was not encapsulated. Junior Lance Krieger 
              laments, &#8220;When I applied to Columbia I was given a nice long 
              interview and I think they realized there was more to me than a 
              piece of paper.&#8221; He was surprised when he applied to Stanford 
              that the school didn&#8217;t incorporate interviews into the application 
              process.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Stanford needs to institute interviews 
              into its admissions process. Interviews will allow admissions officers 
              to identify those students who show promise in areas other than 
              academics. These interviews would prevent the great percentage of 
              those kids who got a 1600 on their SAT but can&#8217;t hit on a 
              girl to save their life from becoming part of the Stanford community.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The admissions process has become 
              more and more hair-splitting every year, with countless valedictorians, 
              class presidents and science whiz-kids being denied admission here 
              at Stanford and elsewhere. Certainly, a lack of talented applicants 
              is not the problem. A perfect and necessary solution to this problem 
              would be to make social aptitude the deciding criteria in the decision 
              process. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Noting how concerned Stanford 
              is with promoting diversity of any kind on campus, one would think 
              they would support a variety of dispositions as well. Currently, 
              we maintain a level of personality homogeneity which would disgust 
              any high-minded admissions officer were they measuring any other 
              distinguishable characteristic. Those students who are socially 
              adept not only improve the academic atmosphere of our campus but 
              also interject the sorely lacking social scene with vibrancy. These 
              are the students Stanford needs. These are the future leaders of 
              America.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Soon, if the administration continues 
              to cut traditions like Full Moon on the Quad and The Bonfire, which 
              generally attract the more social students, we will continue to 
              see a decline in new students who actually had friends in high school. 
              Stanford should not want to dance near this slippery slope when 
              applicants have many other schools to choose from which in many 
              cases offer more excitement.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Ultimately, college is about growing 
              up and maturing, discovering yourself and letting your personality 
              shine through. Never again will college students have the ability 
              to goof off and enjoy the freedom of their adulthood in the same 
              way again. Students on the Stanford campus should be serious about 
              academics, but they shouldn&#8217;t ignore what the spirit of college 
              is all about. Parents know that college&#8217;s most valuable reward 
              is not your diploma, but the life experiences you gain. Don&#8217;t 
              miss out on yours.<br>
