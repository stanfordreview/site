              along the beach in Santa Cruz today, observing all the overweight, 
              poor, and generally unattractive people, it dawned upon me that 
              I truly am superior to most everyone else. I mean, just look at 
              me. I go to Stanford, I'm extremely intelligent, I'm in good shape, 
              I'm socially apt, and, most importantly, I'm rich. 
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Dont get me wrong -- I'm sure 
              a lot of those unattractive middle-aged people have something very 
              unique and amazing about them to offer to the world, but let's be 
              honest with ourselves here a not all of them do. In fact, most of 
              them do not. I am fairly certain that a good chunk of them spend 
              most of their time eating at McDonald's and wondering when the Arch 
              Deluxe will finally make its triumphant return.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Dont get me wrong, I'm not trying 
              to belittle you, the reader, or the Stanford community in general; 
              it's full of talented, amazing people who should be very proud of 
              their unique skills and abilities. Just not as proud as I am.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">These days, you cant leave the 
              gates of your estate or turn on your plasma HDTV with Bang &amp; 
              Olufsen multi-directional surround-sound speakers without hearing 
              the word &quot;equality&quot; being repeatedly crammed down your 
              throat at every turn. Different is inherently unequal, and I am 
              certainly &quot;different&quot; than 99% of other people. Wait, 
              make that 99.9999% - I forgot to include the Stanford Democrats 
              in the original calculation. If no two people are exactly the same, 
              then no two people are exactly equal aaone will always be better 
              than the other. Uniqueness is a positive attribute, but one can 
              be better at being unique than another if ones uniqueness is presented 
              in a more interesting and witty way. Let's be very clear about the 
              fact that just because you do something differently than someone 
              else doesn't mean that you are as good as they are a I mean, when 
              I enter a room wearing thousands of dollars worth of designer, custom-fitted 
              clothing and sit down next to your fat ass in your hideous, mismatched, 
              patchwork collection of rags that the Gap is calling an outfit, 
              I do indeed look objectively better than you.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It's not that you are as good 
              looking as I but just in a different way: you are ugly, your clothes 
              dont match (in fact they smell a bit -- have you washed them in 
              the last three weeks?), and you have no concept of what it takes 
              to succeed. Perhaps you could learn something by looking at me?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Recognizing that I'm one of the 
              most amazing gems this Earth has to offer, I realize that there's 
              even room for someone as amazing as myself to improve. But this 
              realization only comes after giving up on the childhood fantasy 
              of everyone being equal. With all this talk of equality, no one 
              ever admits to themselves, &quot;Hey, this person actually is a 
              lot better than I, maybe this person has traits that I can emulate 
              that will make me a better person!&quot; No one considers the fact 
              that maybe they are not the best they can possibly be. In a world 
              of complete equality, feelings of inadequacy are simply disregarded 
              as the conscious minds error at recognizing a different expression 
              of uniqueness. But certain people are simply better at life than 
              other people, and recognizing these differences provides an example 
              through which one can realize one's own potential for self-improvement. 
              There are in fact a handful of people in the world who are better 
              than I am, but they will not be so for long, because as soon as 
              I meet them I will copy their best traits, continuing my upward 
              trend of self-improvement until the heavens themselves open their 
              gates in awe of my utter perfection.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">On second thought, ignore this 
              article - don't change your behaviour. I like the status quo. In 
              a country full of losers ascribing their faults and inadequacies 
              to inexplicable and ill-defined &quot;unique characteristics&quot;, 
              there is no room for self-improvement. After all, emulation of superior 
              characteristics threatens to destroy your unique character. This 
              all just means there will be less competition for me!
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Well suckers, enjoy basking in 
              all of your unique diversity, but in the mean time, I will be drinking 
              the best champagnes, entertaining the most beautiful women, enjoying 
              my extremely well-compensated job, attending the most exclusive 
              parties, and vacationing in the most exotic locations in the world. 
              If you want to really break the mold and be truly unique, embrace 
              something none of your peers dare: pure, unadulterated elitism.
