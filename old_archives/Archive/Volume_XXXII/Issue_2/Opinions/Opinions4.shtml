          <td colspan="2" class="bodytext"><p align="justify" class="bodytext">“You 
              are either with us or against us” --President Bush, Statement after 
              September 11th terrorist attacks.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">After the tragic destruction and 
              loss of life that occurred on September 11th 2001, President Bush 
              defined a new US foreign policy. Regarding terrorism, he claimed 
              that all nations of the world are either with the United States 
              or they are an ally of terrorism and an enemy of the United States. 
              This newly initiated foreign policy is considered by many to be 
              aggressive and very strongly worded.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">In a sense, President Bush was 
              calling for international cooperation, which if not received, would 
              be followed by preemptive counter-terrorism measures and possibly 
              preventive war. The preventive war component has been witnessed 
              in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the subsequent occupation of that 
              country.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">The President’s foreign policy, 
              especially his decision to invade Iraq, has been an extremely controversial 
              issue of great concern. Many questions have arisen... Was Saddam Hussein 
              an imminent threat? Was the nuclear weapons intelligence faulty? 
              Should Bush have gotten international approval before the invasion?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">All of these questions are currently 
              being widely discussed in the press and various political circles. 
              However, there is another question that ought to addressed and which 
              seems to be overshadowed by the Iraq issue. Is Pakistan cooperating 
              with the United States and complying with President BushÕs foreign 
              policy? And if the answer is no, why is President Bush doing nothing 
              in response?
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">It was recently revealed that 
              Pakistan is responsible for giving nuclear weapons technology to 
              Iran, Libya, and North Korea. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, a Pakistani 
              nuclear scientist, sold these technologies. President Musharraf 
              did not specifically authorize the transfers, and when the United 
              States finally confronted Musharraf about Dr. Khan, he admitted 
              to knowing about the transfers for three years. However, he did 
              nothing to stop Khan for political reasons. The Pakistani President 
              claimed that Dr. Khan was a national hero and made the excuse that 
              he did not want to cause a political backlash.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Regarding the United States' stance 
              on terrorism, there is evidence that Musharraf is allowing terrorist 
              groups in Pakistan to continue operations and activities. In early 
              2002, he allied Pakistan with President Bush's campaign against 
              Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Although Musharraf has declared 
              that he is siding with the United States, there are instances in 
              which he fails to uphold this "alliance."
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">One Islamic militant group which 
              Musharraf allows to continue its activities is the Jamiat ul Ansar, 
              whose leader is Fazlur Rehman Khalil. This group allied itself with 
              Al Qaeda when Khalil cosigned Osama Bin Laden's 1998 edict which 
              declared that it is a Muslim's duty to kill Americans and Jews. 
              Jamiat ul Ansar prints a monthly magazine to raise funds, notify 
              supporters of meetings and activities, and urge volunteers to fight 
              U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. John Walker Lindh of California 
              is serving a sentence for fighting on the side of the Taliban, and 
              one of his charges was that he attended one of Khalil's training 
              camps.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">Another instance of leniency against 
              terrorist groups involved Maulana Masood Azhar, another of Pakistan's 
              radical Muslim clerics. Azhar has an alliance with Bin Laden that 
              dates back to 1993. They cooperated on a project in which terrorist 
              groups attacked U.S.-led forces in Somalia. Musharraf banned Azhar's 
              militant group in 2002, known as the Army of Mohammed, in response 
              to an attack on India's Parliament that left 14 dead. However, just 
              a year later, Pakistani judges ordered the release of Azhar with 
              no charges.
            <p align="justify" class="bodytext">President Bush has stated a very 
              aggressive stance on terrorism. However, in regard to Pakistan, 
              he has not supplemented his insistent policy with assertive action. 
              Pakistan continues to endanger the security of the United States 
              and the world by allowing the transfer of nuclear weapons between 
              countries and permitting terrorist groups to continue operating 
              within its borders. Musharraf has denounced terrorism, but he has 
              not taken full responsive action to support his statement. Similarly, 
              Bush has made a verbal stance against terrorism, but he has not 
              taken an active stance in terms of U.S.-Pakistani relations. Where 
              is the dialogue between Bush and Musharraf? Where is the assertive 
              international diplomacy? A strong foreign policy requires both a 
              forceful statement AND the willingness to take effective action. 
              Many would argue that our soldiers are in Iraq unnecessarily. Meanwhile, 
              we are letting terrorist activities and the exchange of nuclear 
              weapons to slip behind our backs within the borders of Pakistan, 
              our supposed ally.<br>
